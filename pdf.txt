make adidas a better company.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 
2020 was a year like no other. When we started out, we were looking forward to a great year of sport, with 
the UEFA EURO 2020 and the Olympic Games in Tokyo at its core. And with the strong development adidas 
has seen over the last four years, we were well on track to achieving all the long-term targets we had set 
out in our strategy ‘Creating the New’.
 
Then covid-19 struck the world with full force. The global pandemic presents a crisis on a scale many of us 
have never experienced before. The toll it has taken on human life is heartbreaking, while it has also 
caused the largest economic downturn for decades.  
Covid-19 first hit adidas in late January in China. By mid-March, Europe, North America and Latin America 
had also gone into lockdown. Within the space of just three days, 70% of our stores – and those of our 
partners – had closed. We were suddenly put in a position where we were losing revenue, while our costs 
continued to roll in. We reacted quickly. There is no blueprint to deal with a crisis like this, but within just a 
few days we had adjusted our operations to address the situation at hand. 
The health and safety of our employees is our top priority 
From the very beginning of the pandemic, our focus was squarely upon two things:  
─ Securing the well-being, health and safety of our own employees, and of our suppliers. 
─ Steering the company successfully through this unprecedented crisis. 
I am proud to report that we achieved both. 
We implemented comprehensive hygiene standards across all our locations and provided our employees 
with clear guidance – including the preventive measures they should take. We also closed stores and 
offices when required, in line with local regulations. Even today, the vast majority of our employees are 
working from home, but we reacted quickly to provide them with the tools that would enable them to do so. 
We also successfully safeguarded jobs throughout the entire year and rewarded our employees with an 
appreciation payout of € 1,000 each for their extraordinary commitment.
 
2020 financial results 
Despite all the challenges, we used 2020 to make adidas a better company. Our business recovered 
quickly after having hit the lowest point in the second quarter and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. 
We connected with more consumers than ever before and expanded our digital capabilities and reach. We 
continued to invest in sustainability and our people. Last but not least, we increased our operational and 
financial flexibility. As a result, we are now well positioned to tackle both short-term uncertainty and long-
term growth. 
Not surprisingly, our financial results were significantly impacted by the negative effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Revenues decreased 14% on a currency-neutral basis due to the widespread store 
closures and lower traffic once stores reopened. Revenues in Russia/CIS remained flat, while currency-
neutral sales were down in all other major market segments. We were able to achieve a gross margin 
level of 49.7%, limiting the decline to 2.3 percentage points through a disciplined sell-in in a very 
promotional industry environment. As a result of the revenue shortfall, the company’s operating margin 
decreased 7.5 percentage points to 3.8% and net income from continuing operations decreased 78% to 
€ 429 million.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
Exceptional growth in e-commerce 
Overall, the global pandemic accelerated our focus on digital. We took decisive actions to focus on digital 
acceleration by moving available inventory to e-commerce, invested in an agile digital content studio, 
shifted marketing, resources and tech budget toward digital and made sure our day-to-day decisions are 
data-driven with a clear focus on consumer insights and trends. As a result, our e-commerce business 
was up 53% on a currency-neutral basis for the full year, exceeding € 4 billion for the first time in the 
history of our company.
 
Consumer at the center of everything we do 
Our digital capabilities helped us to put our consumers at the center of everything we do. The lockdown 
saw the launch of our most successful digital campaign ever: #hometeam. This campaign was seen by 
more than 400 million people worldwide, with over 3,000 of our athletes and partners getting involved. 
With sporting events resuming in many regions in the second half of the year, we launched our next 
successful digital campaign: ‘Ready for Sport’. It was great to see our athletes and teams back in action, 
winning titles and setting records in our innovative products. Kenyan runner Peres Jepchirchir broke the 
half-marathon world record in our Adizero Adios Pro shoes twice, FC Bayern Munich won the UEFA 
Champions League, and Dominic Thiem claimed his first Grand Slam title at the US Open, just to mention a 
few.
 
Continued investment in sustainability 
Sustainability is an integral part of the adidas business philosophy. We continue to invest in sustainability 
initiatives and, in 2020, we significantly broadened our range of sustainable products and are ahead of our 
plan to have virgin polyester removed from our products by 2024. As part of our partnership with the 
environmental organization Parley for the Oceans, we produced 15 million pairs of shoes using recycled 
plastic waste collected from beaches and coastal regions. We expanded our vegan product offering and 
completely banned the use of fur. 
 
At our corporate sites, we operate modern facilities to generate environmentally friendly energy. We are 
also working closely with our suppliers to implement climate and environmental protection measures at 
their sites. Our objective: to reach climate neutrality by 2050, globally.
 
Commitment to accelerating diversity and inclusion
 
In many respects, we are already a company that leads on diversity issues. adidas is international to its 
very core. People from over 100 nations work at our corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach alone and 
the Executive and Supervisory Boards both have strong international representation. We have also made 
progress in increasing the number of women in leadership positions. Our target for the end of 2020 was to 
have women make up 32% of our leadership positions. We exceeded this target with 35%.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
However, it came to our attention as a result of many individual conversations with our employees – in 
particular with our Black employees – that diversity and inclusion was not being lived consistently across 
our company. Many employees told us – and told me personally – that they believe there are not enough 
equal opportunities for all. This is not acceptable. It is a top priority for us to make adidas an even more 
diverse and inclusive company. In order to do so, we acted upon the following commitments: 
─ Establishing a global Committee to Accelerate Inclusion & Equality. 
─ Signing the Juneteenth Pledge and organizing our first Global Day of Inclusion for all of our employees, 
which will now become an annual company event. 
─ Launching a mandatory Diversity and Inclusion training for all employees. 
─ Setting new targets in the US for increased representation of Black and LatinX people within our US 
workforce. Our aim is to fill at least 30% of all new positions with Black and LatinX people. 
─ Funding 50 university scholarships in the US each year for Black and LatinX students. 
─ Investing $120 million in the US toward ending racism and supporting Black communities through to 
2025.  
We will continue this important journey – together with our employees and partners – to create an adidas 
we can all be proud of. 
Increased financial flexibility 
To successfully navigate the company through 2020, we switched our financial focus entirely onto 
managing our cash in- and outflows when the covid-19 crisis hit us in March. Our measures included the 
establishment of strict cost and working capital controls, the reduction of management compensation, the 
stop of the share buyback program as well as the suspension of dividend payments. In addition, we took 
further steps to guarantee the company’s financial flexibility with approval from the German government 
for a syndicated credit facility amounting to € 3 billion from a consortium of banks including KfW, 
Germany’s state-owned development bank. This facility helped us to bridge the exceptional circumstances 
that arose from the coronavirus pandemic. 
 
In August, we received strong first-time investment-grade ratings from the two leading rating agencies – 
Standard & Poor’s (‘A+’ with a stable outlook) and Moody’s (‘A2’ with a stable outlook). adidas is now one of 
the highest-ranked companies in the sporting goods industry and in Germany. As a result of these ratings, 
adidas is well positioned to gain access to the international capital market at any time. In September, we 
successfully placed two bonds with a total value of € 1 billion as well as our first ever € 500 million 
sustainability bond. In October, we were able to repay the drawn portion of the KfW loan amounting to 
€ 500 million and, in November, we terminated the KfW loan and replaced it completely.

2021 outlook 
We all hope that 2021 will be the year in which the world can leave the coronavirus pandemic behind. For 
us as a company, it will be a milestone year. adidas will play an integral role in important moments in 
sport and culture. We firmly believe, that through sport, we have the power to change lives. As you read 
this, we will have launched our new strategy ‘Own the Game’. It clearly articulates the business drivers, 
categories and markets we will focus on to deliver above industry-average growth and create significant 
value through to 2025. As part of the development of our new five-year strategy, we have assessed 
strategic alternatives for Reebok and decided to begin a formal process aimed at divesting the brand. In 
2021, we will be fast out of the gate in the first year of our strategic cycle and – in combination with our 
strong product pipeline – expect to drive strong sales growth across all market segments. Specifically, we 
expect currency-neutral net sales to increase at a mid- to high-teens rate. Profitability will also see a 
notable recovery. Our operating margin is projected to increase to a level of between 9% and 10%, driven 
by the strong sales growth, gross margin improvement and continued strict cost control. As a result, net 
income from continuing operations is anticipated to increase to a level of between € 1.25 billion and 
€ 1.45 billion.
 
Thank you 
2020 was anything but easy. The only way to get through such a year is by working together as a team. 
Therefore, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to our 62,000 adidas employees. They have 
demonstrated resilience and shown great commitment in these unprecedented times. And I would also 
like to say thank you to you, our shareholders, for the trust you have placed in us. We will continue to do 
everything we can to remain worthy of this trust. I am confident of the attractive prospects the sporting 
goods industry will continue to present for adidas, especially given that many people have developed an 
increased appreciation of well-being. They want to stay fit and healthy through sports. At the same time, 
wearing sportswear is becoming more and more popular, in particular for people working from home. 
adidas will continue to benefit from these trends. As a global leader in our industry with a strong strategy 
in place, we are very well positioned for the years ahead. 
Please take care and stay healthy. 
 
Sincerely yours,

SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT 
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 
2020 was a challenging year for adidas. A year impacted in particular by the unprecedented challenges of 
the coronavirus pandemic. Broad-based store closures as well as lower consumer traffic had a significant 
negative impact on the company’s business activities. adidas has risen to these challenges. While the 
health and safety of our employees, partners, and consumers remained a top priority, the company also 
took advantage of emerging opportunities: The company advanced its digital activities, concluded 
successful refinancing agreements, and further increased diversity within the company. These 
achievements help to ensure that adidas goes strengthened and well equipped into the next strategic 
cycle. Focusing on the most attractive categories, channels, and markets in the global sporting industry, 
the company’s 2025 strategy will allow adidas to gain above-average benefits from structural consumer 
trends. Against this background, the company is in an excellent position to generate profitable growth also 
in the new strategic cycle, and to allow shareholders to continue to participate in the company’s positive 
development. 
 
Monitoring and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board 
In the year under review, we performed all of our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of Association, the 
German Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) and the Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously, as 
in previous years. We regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company and 
diligently and continuously monitored its management activities. The Executive Board involved us directly 
and in a timely and comprehensive manner in all of the company’s fundamental decisions. 
The Executive Board informed us extensively and regularly through written and oral reports. This 
information covered all relevant aspects of the company’s corporate strategy, business planning (including 
financial, investment, and personnel planning), the course of business, and the company’s financial 
position and profitability. We were also kept up to date on matters relating to accounting processes, the 
risk situation and the effectiveness and development of the internal control and risk management systems 
and compliance as well as all major decisions and business transactions. Furthermore, the Executive 
Board always explained immediately and in detail any deviation in the performance of the business from 
the established plans. In the year under review, the principal cause of deviation was the coronavirus 
pandemic, which presented the company with new and unexpected challenges. In order to meet these 
challenges, we increased the communication between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board through 
additional meetings and regular written reports. In particular, the Executive Board informed us of the 
impact of the pandemic on our employees and locations around the world, on our operational 
performance, and on the liquidity of the company. We supported the Executive Board in an advisory 
capacity on all of the measures implemented, each of which was intended to promote the long-term 
prosperity of adidas as well as its employees, consumers, and business partners. 
In addition, the Executive Board provided us with regular, comprehensive written reports to assist with 
preparation for our meetings. We thus always had the opportunity to critically analyze the Executive 
Board’s reports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the entire Supervisory Board 
and to put forward suggestions before passing resolutions after in-depth examination and extensive 
consultation. At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Executive Board was available to discuss and answer 
our questions. In the periods between our meetings, the Executive Board also provided us with extensive 
monthly reports on the current business situation. We critically examined and challenged the information 
provided to us by the Executive Board.

Meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees 
In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board primarily exercised its duties in plenary sessions. 
Members who were unable to participate in the meetings took part in the resolutions by submitting their 
vote in writing. Given the coronavirus pandemic and in order to protect the safety of all persons involved, 
most of our meetings were held virtually. The latest video-conferencing technology was used to ensure an 
open and appropriate discussion between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board within the virtual 
meetings. Despite the very high number of meetings, the Supervisory Board and its committees had a 
consistently high participation rate during the year under review, totaling approximately   97% 
(2019: approximately 96%), which significantly exceeds the targeted minimum participation rate of 75%.
 
The external auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, (‘KPMG’) attended all meetings of 
the Supervisory Board, with the exception of one extraordinary meeting, insofar as no Executive Board 
matters or internal matters of the Supervisory Board were dealt with. Furthermore, KPMG attended all 
meetings of the Audit Committee. 
In the periods between meetings, the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman 
maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conferring on 
matters such as corporate strategy, business planning and development, the risk situation, the control and 
risk management as well as compliance. A key issue during the year under review was the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on the company and the measures taken to mitigate it. In addition, the Supervisory 
Board Chairman was informed about events of fundamental importance for evaluating the situation, 
development and management of the company, when necessary also at short notice. The Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board regularly reported during meetings on discussions with the Executive Board outside the 
Supervisory Board meetings. 
The Supervisory Board also met regularly without the Executive Board members, in particular to discuss 
internal affairs of the Supervisory Board as well as personnel and compensation matters relating to the 
Executive Board.

2 Member of the Supervisory Board from the end of the Annual General Meeting on August 11, 2020. Christian Klein was unable to attend one Supervisory Board 
meeting in the year under review due to an excused absence. Due to his shorter term of office in the year under review and the lower number of meetings (three 
meetings), this resulted in a relatively low attendance rate of 67%, which is not representative. 
Tasks and topics for the entire Supervisory Board 
In the year under review, there were ten meetings of the entire Supervisory Board (2019: eight meetings). 
One resolution was passed by way of a circular resolution. 
The following subject areas were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board for regular discussion at 
Supervisory Board meetings: the development of sales and earnings, the employment situation as well as 
the financial position of the company and the business development of the company’s individual 
operations, brands, and markets. In addition, we focused on the serious impact of the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic on the global economy and on the company. From the outset, our top priority was the health and 
safety of our employees, shareholders, consumers, and partners. In addition, we examined in detail the 
considerable decline in sales, profit and cash flow from operating activities as well as the associated 
liquidity management within the company. We also considered the rapidly accelerating top-line growth in 
our e-commerce channel. The Executive Board provided regular reports on the implementation of 
measures aimed at promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion at adidas. Finally, we discussed the annual 
and multi-year planning of the Executive Board. In particular, we examined the development of the new 
long-term strategy that will run from the 2021 to 2025 financial years. In our meetings, the Executive 
Board provided regular reports on the status of development and consulted extensively with the 
Supervisory Board. 
In accordance with statutory regulations or the Rules of Procedure, certain transactions and measures by 
the Executive Board require the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board discussed 
transactions requiring approval as and when they arose and gave its approval to resolution items after 
detailed reviews, in some cases after preparation by the relevant committees. In addition, the Supervisory

Board regularly discussed personnel and compensation matters with respect to the Executive Board as 
well as questions of corporate governance.
 ► SEE COMPENSATION REPORT ► SEE DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
At the February meeting of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board reported on the company’s 
situation and preliminary financial results for the 2019 financial year as well as the development process 
for the new strategy. Furthermore, we deliberated on major legal disputes involving adidas as well as 
business development at Reebok. We also examined the upcoming election of a shareholder 
representative to the Supervisory Board at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. In addition, we elected Bodo 
Uebber to the Audit Committee with effect from January 1, 2020, following the departure of Ian Gallienne 
as Audit Committee member on December 31, 2019. Other topics of discussion included Executive Board 
compensation and corporate governance. In particular, we addressed the independence of Supervisory 
Board members as well as the Declaration on Corporate Governance (Corporate Governance Report). In 
addition, having determined the degree of target achievement and having discussed in detail the individual 
performance of Executive Board members, we set the short- and long-term variable compensation to be 
paid to the Executive Board members for the 2019 financial year. We also determined the appropriateness 
of Executive Board compensation following an internal appropriateness test. 
At the balance sheet meeting in March, the Executive Board reported on the financial results for the past 
financial year as well as on the audit of the 2019 annual financial statements and consolidated financial 
statements. Before the Supervisory Board passed the resolution, the auditor reported on the material 
results of the audit, including the results of the examination of the content of the non-financial statement 
commissioned by the Supervisory Board in accordance with § 111 section 2 sentence 4 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG). After in-depth examination of the financial statements and on 
the basis of the independent auditor’s report and the Audit Committee report on the audit results, the 
Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well 
as the combined Management Report, including the non-financial statement for adidas AG and the adidas 
Group. The annual financial statements were thus adopted. In addition, the Executive Board explained the 
current business situation of the company, also in relation to the unforeseeable impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic. Another topic of discussion was the ongoing development of the long-term strategy. We also 
approved the merger of the non-operational adidas anticipation GmbH with adidas AG as a measure 
requiring approval. Furthermore, we approved the Supervisory Board Report to the Annual General 
Meeting as well as the proposed resolutions to be submitted to the 2020 Annual General Meeting, 
including the proposal on the appropriation of retained earnings for the 2019 financial year. The 
Supervisory Board later revoked the resolution on the Annual General Meeting after the Executive Board 
decided to postpone the 2020 Annual General Meeting from May to August in line with restrictions imposed 
by the competent German authorities and as a result of the ban on large in-person meetings. In addition, 
at the March meeting of the Supervisory Board, we determined the criteria and targets for the variable, 
performance-based compensation of Executive Board members for the 2020 financial year. Given the 
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the company’s business situation and the importance of securing 
the company’s liquidity, we decided in March, in agreement with the Executive Board, to postpone the 
payment of the short- and long-term variable compensation for the 2019 financial year. In addition, the 
Executive Board members agreed to waive the payment of 50% of their contractually agreed fixed salary 
for an indefinite period.
 
In April, there were two meetings of the Supervisory Board. Both meetings focused on mitigation of the 
coronavirus pandemic as well as on liquidity management and the company’s financial strategy. Within 
this framework, we approved a syndicated loan facility for adidas AG from a consortium of banks with 
participation from KfW. As a liquidity management measure, the Executive Board members waived their 
annually granted short- and long-term bonuses for the 2020 financial year. In addition, the Executive 
Board presented the Q1 2020 results and reported on the progress of the digital transformation at adidas.

A further two meetings of the Supervisory Board were held in June. The first of these, at the beginning of 
the month, focused on the current business situation and, in particular, the impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic on the operating business and the measures taken to mitigate it. In light of the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic, the Supervisory Board members also agreed to donate 30% of their annual 
compensation in the year under review to SOS Children’s Villages and other good causes. In addition, we 
passed a new resolution on the invitation and agenda for the virtual 2020 Annual General Meeting. The 
Supervisory Board approved the proposed resolutions to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting of 
adidas AG on August 11, 2020, including the proposal on the appropriation of retained earnings for the 
2019 financial year. At the second of the June meetings, the Supervisory Board approved the termination 
by mutual agreement of the appointment of Karen Parkin as a member of the Executive Board of 
adidas AG with effect from June 30, 2020. Furthermore, the termination agreement with respect to Karen 
Parkin’s Executive Board service contract was approved. 
The August meeting focused on the Q2 and half-year results for 2020 as well as the financial strategy of 
adidas AG. With regard to the financial strategy, the Supervisory Board authorized the Executive Board to 
issue non-share-based bonds and conclude a syndicated revolving loan facility. In addition, we deliberated 
extensively and in detail on the issues of diversity and inclusion within adidas as well as the development 
of the new  strategy. We also addressed key initiatives in the area of sustainability and agreed to 
commission KPMG to examine the content of the non-financial statement with limited assurance. In 
connection with the election of the new Supervisory Board member by the Annual General Meeting on 
August 11, 2020, we also addressed the composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees. Other 
topics covered at the meeting included personnel and compensation matters of the Executive Board. After 
extensive consultation, the Supervisory Board reappointed CEO Kasper Rorsted as a member of the 
Executive Board of adidas AG for a further five years. In addition, the Supervisory Board confirmed its 
approval of Brian Grevy’s external board of directors mandate at Pitzner Gruppen Holding A/S. We also 
conducted a horizontal comparison of Executive Board compensation and determined that the 
compensation provided was appropriate. As the company’s liquidity improved, we decided to pay the 
Executive Board members the fixed compensation that had been deferred since April 2020 and to resume 
payment of the monthly fixed salary at the contractually agreed amount. 
At the September meeting of the Supervisory Board, we discussed succession planning for the Executive 
Board function Global Human Resources and, after extensive consultation, appointed Amanda Rajkumar 
as a member of the Executive Board of adidas AG from January 2021. We also approved the Executive 
Board service contract to be concluded with Amanda Rajkumar. 
At the meeting in October, we discussed the preliminary Q3 2020 results and the development process for 
the new strategy. The Executive Board reported on the financing arrangements, in particular the bonds 
issued. In addition, we discussed the digital strategy as well as ongoing developments and progress made 
in our e-commerce channel. The Executive Board then outlined the latest developments in diversity and 
inclusion at adidas. Furthermore, we approved the potential assumption of Kasper Rorsted’s external 
supervisory board mandate at Siemens AG. We also examined the competency profile for the Supervisory 
Board, including targets for its composition, and discussed the results of our self-assessment (efficiency 
examination). Based on these results, we derived selective measures to improve the organization of the 
Supervisory Board’s work. In general, the self-assessment results confirmed the high effectiveness of the 
work of the Supervisory Board and its committees.

The December meeting focused on the budget and investment planning presented by the Executive Board 
for the 2021 financial year, which we approved after detailed consultation, as well as the marketing and 
sponsorship agreements concluded in the year under review. Together with the Executive Board, we 
discussed in depth the new strategy planned for the 2021 financial year onwards. In addition, following 
corresponding preparation by the General Committee, we discussed the new compensation system for 
members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, and reviewed and revised the Rules of Procedure 
of the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee in light of legal changes and the requirements of the Code. 
In this context, it was also decided to maintain the deductible of at least 10% of the claim in connection 
with the insurance of Supervisory Board members against risks arising from their professional activities 
(D&O insurance). Furthermore, we discussed the assessment of the independence of the Supervisory 
Board members and the Declaration of Compliance with the Code. Finally, we approved Harm Ohlmeyer’s 
honorary executive board mandate at the WHU Foundation.
 
Tasks and topics for the committees 
In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner, we have established a total of five standing 
Supervisory Board committees. The committees prepare resolutions and topics for the meetings of the 
entire Supervisory Board. Within the legally permissible framework and in appropriate cases, we have 
furthermore delegated the Supervisory Board’s authority to pass certain resolutions to individual 
committees. With the exception of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all 
the standing committees. The respective committee chairmen report to the Supervisory Board on their 
work as well as the content and results of the committee meetings on a regular and comprehensive basis. 
The Steering Committee did not meet in the year under review. 
The General Committee held nine meetings during the year under review (2019: six meetings). One 
resolution was passed by way of a circular resolution. The main task of the General Committee was to 
prepare resolutions for the entire Supervisory Board on personnel and compensation matters of the 
Executive Board. In particular, it provided comprehensive advice on the departure of Karen Parkin, the 
appointment of Amanda Rajkumar, and the reappointment of Kasper Rorsted. The General Committee also 
dealt with the assumption of company-external mandates by Executive Board members. Regarding 
Executive Board compensation, the General Committee drafted proposals for resolutions on short- and 
long-term variable performance-based compensation (targets, target achievement, and amount), and pre-
examined the appropriateness of the Executive Board compensation. Furthermore, the General 
Committee dealt intensively with the development of the new compensation system and long-term 
succession planning for the Executive Board as well as with the changed requirements of the German 
Stock Corporation Act and the Code in regard to corporate governance.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The Audit Committee held five meetings in the year under review (2019: five meetings). The Chief Financial 
Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members in detail. 
In addition to the monitoring of the accounting process, the committee’s work also focused on the audit of 
the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2019, including the 
combined Management Report and the non-financial statement of adidas AG and the Group, as well as the 
Executive Board’s proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following an in-depth review 
of the audit reports with the auditor, the Audit Committee decided to recommend that the Supervisory 
Board approve the 2019 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the 
Audit Committee prepared the audit of the non-financial statement and resolved to recommend that the 
Supervisory Board commission KPMG with the examination of the content of the non-financial statement 
with limited assurance pursuant to § 111 section 2 sentence 4 AktG. Following in-depth discussions, the 
Audit Committee also made a recommendation to the Supervisory Board regarding the proposal to the 
2020 Annual General Meeting for the appointment of the auditor. The Audit Committee declared to the 
Supervisory Board that the recommendation was free from undue influence by a third party and that no 
clause of the kind referred to in Article 16 section 6 of the EU Regulation No. 537/2014 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014 on specific requirements regarding the statutory audit of 
public-interest entities was imposed upon it. 
In the year under review, the Audit Committee dealt intensively with the continued development and 
monitoring of the effectiveness of the risk management system, the internal audit system, the internal 
control system, and the compliance management system. Other matters discussed in detail were the 
assignment of the audit mandate to the auditor appointed by the Annual General Meeting and the 
determination of the audit fees and key audit matters. The Audit Committee also monitored the 
independence and qualification of the auditor as well as the quality of the audit. Finally, the Audit 
Committee discussed the quarterly financial results and the half-year financial report. In the year under 
review, the Audit Committee was also heavily occupied with the impending external rotation of the auditor 
in 2023 and defined the key parameters regarding the tendering process. In addition, the Audit Committee 
dealt extensively with the audit plan and risk management report. At each committee meeting, the Audit 
Committee was also informed about the findings and developments of internal audit as well as in the area 
of compliance. 
Furthermore, in the meetings of the Audit Committee topics such as data protection and information 
security, contract management, and the bank account management system at adidas were discussed. 
Finally, the Audit Committee discussed the company’s internal guidelines for monitoring compliance with 
the regulations governing transactions with related companies and persons as well as the new 
EU Taxonomy Regulation. 
The Nomination Committee held two meetings in the year under review (2019: two meetings). In 
particular, it prepared the proposals of the Supervisory Board to the 2020 and 2021 Annual General 
Meeting regarding the election of shareholder representatives. Drawing on the Supervisory Board’s own 
competency profile for members of the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee created a 
requirements profile that it then used to assess the suitability of candidates. The Nomination Committee 
also advised on the suitability and independence of candidates in relation to the regulatory requirements. 
The Mediation Committee to be established in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act 
(Mitbestimmungsgesetz — MitbestG) did not have to be convened in the year under review.

Election and composition of the Supervisory Board 
Igor Landau, a long-serving member and Chairman of the Supervisory Board, was elected as a 
shareholder representative at the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019 until the end of the 2020 Annual 
General Meeting. With Igor Landau’s term of office set to expire, the Supervisory Board proposed a new 
candidate for election to the 2020 Annual General Meeting following detailed consultation and preparation 
by the Nomination Committee. The 2020 Annual General Meeting approved the Supervisory Board’s 
proposal by a large majority and elected Christian Klein as a new member of the Supervisory Board from 
the end of the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG on August 11, 2020 until the end of the Annual General 
Meeting that ratifies the actions of the Supervisory Board for the 2023 financial year. 
► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
With the expiry of Igor Landau’s term of office, it was necessary to amend the composition and 
memberships of the committees. With effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting, the 
Supervisory Board elected Thomas Rabe as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Ian Gallienne as 
additional Deputy Chairman. The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board elected 
Ian Gallienne as the new member of the Nomination Committee and Mediation Committee. 
Herbert Kauffmann, the long-serving Chairman of the Audit Committee of adidas AG, was elected as a 
shareholder representative at the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019 until the end of the 2021 Annual 
General Meeting. To ensure a smooth handover of the chairmanship of the Audit Committee, Bodo Uebber, 
who was appointed to the Audit Committee at the beginning of the year under review, was elected 
Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. 
With Herbert Kauffmann’s term of office set to expire, the Supervisory Board will propose a new candidate 
for election as shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board to the 2021 Annual General Meeting. 
Prior to the Supervisory Board submitting a proposal, a diligent selection process for suitable candidates 
takes place. The selection criteria for candidates are determined using a pre-defined requirements profile 
and are based on the objectives set by the Supervisory Board for the composition of the Supervisory Board, 
taking into account the competency profile, legal requirements, and applicable recommendations of the 
Code. 
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for undertaking any necessary training 
and further education measures required for their tasks. To assist them in their role, the company offered 
Supervisory Board members who joined the Supervisory Board during the year under review or who 
assumed new responsibilities within the Supervisory Board an introduction to the work of the Supervisory 
Board and/or to new areas of responsibility within adidas AG. Furthermore, the company regularly informs 
the Supervisory Board about current legislative changes as well as opportunities for external training, and 
provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature. 
Changes to the Executive Board  
In September 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Amanda Rajkumar as a new member of the Executive 
Board with responsibility for Global Human Resources, effective January 2021. Amanda Rajkumar succeeds 
Karen Parkin, who left the Executive Board on June 30, 2020. In addition, we extended the mandate of CEO 
Kasper Rorsted by a further five years until 2026

Examination of the annual financial  statements and consolidated financial statements  
The 2020 Annual General Meeting elected KPMG as auditor and Group auditor for the 2020 financial year 
as proposed by the Supervisory Board and recommended by the Audit Committee. Prior to this, KPMG had 
confirmed to both the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee that there are no circumstances which 
could prejudice its independence as auditor or which could cast doubt on KPMG’s independence. In this 
respect, KPMG also declared to which extent non-audit services were rendered for the company in the 
previous financial year or are contractually agreed upon for the following year. 
KPMG audited the 2020 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance 
with § 315e of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) in compliance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as they are to be applied in the European Union, and 
issued an unqualified opinion thereon. This also applies to the 2020 annual financial statements of adidas 
AG, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code, and the combined 
Management Report of adidas AG and the adidas Group. Furthermore, at the request of the Supervisory 
Board, KPMG audited the non-financial statement. The financial statements, the proposal on the 
appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor’s reports were distributed by the Executive Board to all 
Supervisory Board members in a timely manner. 
The financial statements were examined in depth, with a particular focus on legality and regularity, in the 
presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 8, 2021 and at the balance sheet 
meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 9, 2021, during which the Executive Board explained the 
financial statements in detail. At both meetings, the auditor reported on the material results of the audit, 
inter alia with regard to the focus points agreed and the key audit matters and was available for questions 
and the provision of additional information. The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with 
respect to the internal control and risk management system relating to the accounting process. Prior to 
the passing of the resolution, the auditor reported on the results of the examination of the non-financial 
statement as commissioned by the Supervisory Board in accordance with § 111 section 2 sentence 4 AktG. 
In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed in depth and approved the Executive Board’s proposal 
concerning the appropriation of retained earnings for the 2020 financial year. 
Based on our own audits of the annual and consolidated financial statements (including the non-financial 
statement), we came to the conclusion that there are no objections to be raised. Following the recomm-
endation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board therefore approved the audit results and the 
financial statements prepared by the Executive Board, including the non-financial statement for the 2020 
financial year. The annual financial statements were thus adopted. The annual financial statements are

KPMG has been acting as auditor and Group auditor for adidas AG since the 1995 financial year. On the 
basis of the transitional periods of Article 41 Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, KPMG may not be reappointed 
as auditor after June 17, 2023. For this reason, an external rotation shall be conducted for the audit of the 
adidas AG financial statements for the 2023 financial year. Drawing on recommendations from the Audit 
Committee, the Supervisory Board will submit to the 2023 Annual General Meeting its proposal for a new 
auditor to audit the annual and consolidated financial statements of adidas AG as well as a possible review 
of the half-year financial report following a selection process that takes into account the criteria of 
Article 16 section 3 of the EU Auditors' Regulation. The Audit Committee discussed in detail the key data 
and criteria of the selection process in accordance with the requirements of Article 16 section 3 of the EU 
Audit Regulation and decided to conduct the tendering and selection process for the new auditor during 
the 2021 financial year. 
Expression of thanks 
On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Igor Landau, long-serving member and 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board who departed during the year under review, for his enormous 
commitment to the company and exceptional achievements in office. Furthermore, I wish to thank the 
current Executive Board, the departed Executive Board member Karen Parkin as well as all employees 
around the world for their great personal dedication and their ongoing commitment in these challenging 
times. I would also like to express my thanks for the enduring trust and cooperation between the employee 
and shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board.

DECLARATION ON CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE  
Corporate Governance stands for responsible and transparent management and corporate control 
oriented toward a sustainable increase in value. We are convinced that good corporate governance is an 
essential foundation for sustainable corporate success and enhances the confidence placed in our 
company by our shareholders, business partners, and employees, as well as the financial markets. 
Declaration of the adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board on the German 
Corporate Governance Code pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz 
– AktG) 
The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board issued the last Declaration of Compliance with the 
German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to § 161 AktG in December 2019. Insofar as it is related to 
the past, the following declaration refers to the recommendations of the ‘Government Commission on the 
German Corporate Governance Code’ as of February 7, 2017, published in the Federal Gazette on 
April 24, 2017 and May 19, 2017 (corrected version) (‘Code 2017’); as far as it is related to the present and 
future, the following declaration refers to the recommendations in the version as of December 16, 2019, 
published in the Federal Gazette on May 20, 2020 (‘Code 2019’ or ‘Code’). 
1. The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board declare that since the last declaration, the 
recommendations of the Code 2017 have been met with the following exception: 
Recommendation 5.4.5 Section 1 Sentence 2 Code 2017 
One member of the Supervisory Board, Ian Gallienne, holds more than three mandates in supervisory 
bodies of non-Group companies which are listed at a stock exchange or have similar requirements. Ian 
Gallienne is Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (‘GBL’). GBL is a holding company that is 
regularly represented in the supervisory bodies of portfolio companies as an institutional investor, inter 
alia by its Chief Executive Officer. All companies (apart from adidas AG) in which Ian Gallienne is a member 
of the supervisory body are portfolio companies or subsidiaries of GBL or are under joint control of GBL 
and therefore belong to the same group of companies. They have to be attributed to his main occupation as 
Chief Executive Officer of GBL.  
We are of the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, the recommendation 5.4.5 section 1 sentence 2 
Code 2017 is thus not applicable to Ian Gallienne. For precautionary reasons, however, a deviation is 
declared. The Supervisory Board has also assured itself that Ian Gallienne has sufficient time to duly 
perform his duties as a member of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG. 
2. The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board also declare that the recommendations of the 
Code 2019 have been and are met with the following deviations: 
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 1 Code 2019 
With regards to the mandates held by Ian Gallienne, reference is made to the above explanations. We are 
of the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, the recommendation C.5 alternative 1 Code 2019 is 
also not applicable to Ian Gallienne. However, a deviation is declared for precautionary reasons. 
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 2 Code 2019 
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Thomas Rabe, also is Chief Executive Officer of the listed 
company RTL Group S.A., Luxembourg. In this respect, the company deviates from recommendation C.5 
alternative 2. However, the Supervisory Board is convinced that the mandate of Thomas Rabe at RTL 
Group S.A. does not affect the due performance of his duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In

particular, the Supervisory Board has assured itself that Thomas Rabe has sufficient time to perform his 
duties.  
Recommendations G.1 and G.10 Sentence 2 Code 2019 
In comparison to the Code 2017, the Code 2019 contains modified recommendations for the Executive 
Board compensation. The current Executive Board compensation system, as resolved by the Supervisory 
Board and approved by the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG on May 9, 2018, does not fully comply 
with the new recommendations G.1 and G.10 sentence 2 Code 2019. The Supervisory Board will propose a 
modified Executive Board compensation system to the 2021 Annual General Meeting which fully complies 
with the recommendations of the Code 2019.

Dual board system 
As a globally operating public listed company with its registered seat in Herzogenaurach, Germany, 
adidas AG is subject to, inter alia, the provisions of German stock corporation law. A dual board system, 
which assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and advice and monitoring of the 
Executive Board to the Supervisory Board, is one of the fundamental principles of German stock 
corporation law. These two boards are strictly separated both in terms of members and competencies. 
However, both boards cooperate closely in the interest of the company. 
Composition and working methods of the Executive Board 
The composition of our Executive Board, which consists of six members, reflects the international 
character of our company. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company, 
determining the Group’s strategic orientation, agreeing the strategy with the Supervisory Board, and 
ensuring its implementation. Further, it defines business targets, company policy, and the organization of 
the Group. The Executive Board is in charge of preparing the quarterly statements, the half-year report, 
and the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined 
Management Report of adidas AG and the Group. Moreover, it prepares a combined non-financial 
statement for the company and the Group. Additionally, the Executive Board ensures appropriate risk 
management and risk controlling as well as compliance with statutory regulations and internal guidelines. 
In this regard, the Executive Board is responsible for implementing an adequate compliance management 
system which meets the requirements of the company’s risk situation. It is bound to the company’s 
interest and obligated to strive for a sustained increase in company value. 
Notwithstanding the Executive Board’s overall responsibility, its members are individually responsible for 
managing their respective operations in accordance with the Business Allocation Plan for the Executive 
Board. There are no Executive Board committees. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for lead 
management and development of the company, including the coordination of the operations, brands, and 
markets. The members of the Executive Board keep each other informed regularly and comprehensively 
about all significant developments in their business areas and align on all cross-functional measures. 
Collaboration within the Executive Board is further governed by the Rules of Procedure of the Executive 
Board and the Business Allocation Plan. These documents specifically stipulate requirements for 
meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the Supervisory Board.

The Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely for the benefit of the company. The 
Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, extensively, and in a timely manner on all 
matters relevant to the company’s strategy, planning, business development, financial position, and 
compliance as well as on material business risks. Fundamental questions related to the corporate 
strategy and its implementation are thoroughly discussed and agreed with the Supervisory Board.  
The Executive Board is appointed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is committed to 
promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion at adidas. Diversity is understood in the broadest sense, 
including age, gender, cultural origin, nationality, educational background, professional qualifications, and 
experience. Greater diversity on the Executive Board will help secure the long-term success of adidas by 
taking diverse perspectives into account. In addition, the Supervisory Board has agreed upon an age limit 
of 65 years for Executive Board members. 
The General Committee of the Supervisory Board already accounts for diversity when selecting candidates 
for Executive Board positions. Every decision by the Supervisory Board on the composition of the Executive 
Board is made in the best interests of the company and with due consideration of all the circumstances in 
each individual case. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the current composition of the Executive 
Board meets the diversity requirement outlined above.  
No member of the Executive Board has accepted a Supervisory Board chair or more than two Supervisory 
Board mandates in non-group listed companies or in supervisory bodies of non-group companies with 
comparable requirements.

Composition and working methods of the Supervisory Board 
Our Supervisory Board consists of 16 members. It comprises eight shareholder representatives and eight 
employee representatives in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – 
MitbestG). The shareholder representatives are elected by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, and the employee representatives by the employees.
 ► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The most recent regular elections to the Supervisory Board were held in the 2019 financial year. In the 
2020 financial year, the Annual General Meeting appointed Christian Klein to the Supervisory Board as a 
shareholder representative. This by-election was required as the term of office of Igor Landau, the former 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board, ended at the conclusion of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. The 
departure of Igor Landau also necessitated a new Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory 
Board elected Thomas Rabe to this role with effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. The 
terms of office of the current members of the Supervisory Board end at the conclusion of the 2024 Annual 
General Meeting – with the sole exception of Herbert Kauffmann, whose term ends at the conclusion of the 
2021 Annual General Meeting.

Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board 
In its meeting in October 2020, the Supervisory Board agreed upon the objectives for its composition 
(including the competency profile for the entire Supervisory Board), taking into account the 
recommendations of the Code. These objectives are published on our website. According to these 
objectives, the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that qualified monitoring of and 
advice to the Executive Board are ensured. Its members as a whole are expected to have the knowledge, 
skills, and professional experience required to properly perform the tasks of a supervisory board in a 
capital market-oriented international company in the sporting goods industry. To this end, it is ensured 
that the Supervisory Board as a whole possesses the competencies considered essential in view of adidas’ 
activities. This includes, in particular, in-depth knowledge and experience in the sporting goods and 
sports- and leisurewear industry, in the business of fast-moving consumer-oriented goods and in the 
areas of digital transformation and information technology (including IT security), production, marketing, 
and sales, in particular in the e-commerce and retail sector. Moreover, the Supervisory Board is expected 
to possess knowledge and experience in the markets relevant to adidas, in particular the Asian and US 
markets, and in the management of a large international company. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board as 
a whole must possess knowledge and experience in the areas of business strategy development and 
implementation, human resources planning and management, accounting and financial reporting, 
controlling/risk management, governance/compliance, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability. 
At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the areas of accounting or auditing 
of annual accounts. Additionally, the Supervisory Board members as a whole are expected to be familiar 
with the sporting goods industry.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
Regarding the independence of its members, the Supervisory Board considers the following provisions to 
be appropriate: More than half of the Supervisory Board members should be independent within the 
meaning of the Code, whereby it is assumed that the independence of employee representatives is not 
impaired either by their role as employee representatives or their status as adidas employees. If we 
consider shareholder representatives and employee representatives separately, more than half of the 
Supervisory Board members in each of these groups must be independent. From the company’s view and 
following the regulations of the German Corporate Governance Code, Supervisory Board members are to 
be considered independent if  they have no personal or business relationship with the company or its 
Executive Board that may cause a substantial, and not merely temporary, conflict of interest. 
More than two-thirds of the shareholder representatives must be free of any potential conflicts of interest. 
This applies in particular to potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an advisory or board 
role among customers, suppliers, lenders, or other third parties. As a rule, members of the Supervisory 
Board should not have a board-level or advisory role with any key competitor and should not have a 
personal relationship with any key competitor. 
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is committed to a diverse composition in terms of age, gender, 
cultural origin, nationality, educational background, professional qualifications, and experience. An 
adequate number of the shareholder representatives should have long-standing international experience. 
In addition, each Supervisory Board member must ensure that they have sufficient time to properly 
perform the tasks associated with the mandate. In general, the age limit for the Supervisory Board should 
be 72 years at the time of their appointment. As a rule, the length of membership in the Supervisory Board 
should not exceed 15 years or three terms of office. 
In the Supervisory Board’s assessment, the Supervisory Board as a whole in its current composition 
fulfills the objectives stated and the competency profile. With Bodo Uebber, Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, at least one member of the Supervisory Board has proven expertise in the areas of accounting 
or auditing of annual accounts. The names of the independent shareholder representatives are set out in 
the overview of all Supervisory Board members in this Annual Report. In the opinion of the Supervisory 
Board, all shareholder representatives qualified as ‘independent’ in the year under review.

measures of the Executive Board with fundamental significance are subject to prior approval by the 
Supervisory Board or by a Supervisory Board committee. The respective details are set out in § 9 of the 
Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG. Furthermore, the requirement of prior 
Supervisory Board approval is stipulated in some resolutions by the Annual General Meeting.  
The Supervisory Board is also responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the Executive Board 
members as well as for the allocation of their areas of responsibility. The respective proposals are 
prepared by the General Committee. When appointing new Executive Board members, the Supervisory 
Board aims to select candidates with a wide range of complementary skills to ensure the best possible 
Executive Board composition for the company, keeping long-term succession planning in mind. The 
Supervisory Board takes a structural approach in its succession planning for the Executive Board. This is 
based on multiple planning horizons. Accordingly, the company has established a number of management 
groups (Core Leadership Group [CLG], Extended Leadership Group [ELG], and High Potentials). This 
ensures a sustainable approach to identifying and evaluating successor candidates for Executive Board 
positions, while also accommodating the company’s diversity concept. The Supervisory Board discusses 
succession planning on a regular basis.  
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board determines the Executive Board compensation system, examines it 
regularly and decides on the individual overall compensation of each Executive Board member. Further 
information on Executive Board compensation is compiled in the Compensation Report.

Commitment to the promotion of equal participation of women and men in leadership 
positions  
When filling leadership positions in the company, the Executive Board takes diversity into account and 
aims for an appropriate consideration of women in particular. The Supervisory Board is also convinced 
that an increase in the number of women in leadership positions within the company is necessary to 
ensure that, in the future, a larger number of suitable female candidates are available for Executive Board 
positions. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board therefore recognize the enormous importance of 
the company’s initiatives to foster diversity and inclusion and to promote women to leadership positions.
 
► 
 SEE OUR PEOPLE 
In August 2017, the Supervisory Board set a target for female representation on the Executive Board of 1/7 
(14.29%), with a deadline of June 30, 2022. That target is met as a result of Amanda Rajkumar joining the 
Executive Board.  
In addition, the Executive Board has set targets and deadlines for female representation in the first two 
management levels of adidas AG. The targets are 24.2% for the first management level below the 
Executive Board and 30% for the second management level. The deadline for both targets is December 
31, 2021. 
On the first management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 
18% at the balance sheet date. The target figure was thus not achieved. In this respect, it must be noted 
that adidas AG has only a small number of leadership positions on this management level; therefore, 
minor changes already result in considerable changes in percentage numbers. The missing of the defined 
target figure is particularly attributable to unplanned departures from the company in the year under 
review and partly also to replacements that only take effect in the following year. Due to the coronavirus 
pandemic, fewer replacements or personnel measures than originally planned were realized. On the 
second management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 27% at 
the balance sheet date. The target figure was thus not achieved. This slight shortfall is also particularly 
attributable to unplanned departures from the company in the year under review and to the exceptional 
circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic. As at balance sheet date, female representation in 
leadership positions on a global level however amounted to 35.2%. The target figure of 32% for the year 
2020 was thus clearly exceeded. The company will continue to intensify its efforts to remain an attractive 
employer in the future, with a particular focus on a long-term approach for equal participation in 
leadership positions – both through recruitment and through appropriate talent and succession planning 
management. 
In accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG, at least 30% of the members of the Supervisory Board 
have to be female and at least 30% have to be male. In the year under review, the shareholder 
representatives and the employee representatives each resolved in accordance with § 96 section 2 
sentence 3 AktG that this minimum quota shall be fulfilled separately for the shareholder representatives

and the employee representatives. As at December 31, 2020, altogether five of the 16 Supervisory Board 
mandates of the company were held by women, two on the shareholder representative side and three on 
the employee representative side. The minimum quota required is thus fulfilled on both sides. 
Avoiding conflicts of interest 
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are obligated to disclose any conflicts of 
interest to the Supervisory Board without delay. Substantial transactions between the company and 
members of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board 
approval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require 
Supervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the 
handling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive 
Board and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest.

COMPENSATION REPORT 
For adidas, transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board is an essential element of good corporate governance. The Compensation Report is a 
component of the combined Management Report and outlines the principles of the compensation system 
for the members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as well as the level and structure of the 
compensation system in accordance with the legal requirements and the recommendations of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (‘Code‘). 
COMPENSATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS 
The compensation system which has been applicable for the members of the Executive Board since the 
2018 financial year was adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018. 
In view of the Act on the Implementation of the Second Shareholders’ Rights Directive (Gesetz zur 
Umsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechterichtlinie – ‘ARUG II’) and the new version of the German 
Corporate Governance Code, structural changes to the compensation system for the Executive Board 
members will become necessary. The new compensation system, revised in accordance with these 
requirements, will be presented for approval at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The new compensation 
system will take also into account the new long-term strategy applicable from the 2021 financial year, and 
the short-term and long-term performance-related compensation components for Executive Board 
members will reflect the operational and strategic goals of the company outlined in the new strategy. 
Finally, our shareholders' expectations regarding the further development of the compensation system 
will also be taken into account. 
The details on the revised compensation system are provided in the invitation to the 2021 Annual General 
Meeting, which is expected to be published in March 2021. 
COMPENSATION SYSTEM 
Principles of the compensation system 
The compensation system for Executive Board members, which is applicable until the end of the 
2020 financial year, is geared toward creating an incentive for successful, sustainable, and long-term 
corporate management and development. The compensation is therefore structured with an appropriate 
balance of fixed non-performance-related components and variable performance-related components. 
The variable performance-related components are based mainly on forward-looking, multi-year 
performance criteria. They are designed in such a way that both positive and negative developments are 
considered. Moreover, the incentive to achieve the long-term targets that determine the multi-year 
variable performance-related compensation component is higher than the incentive to achieve the targets 
that determine the one-year variable performance-related compensation component. To promote the 
execution of the corporate strategy, the performance targets selected for the variable performance-
related compensation are derived from the operational and strategic goals. Therefore, at least 80% of the 
variable performance-related compensation is directly linked to the short- and long-term sales and 
profitability targets externally communicated, thus bringing the compensation of the Executive Board 
members directly in line with the interests of the shareholders.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
When designing the compensation system and determining the Executive Board compensation, the 
Supervisory Board takes into account the size and global orientation, the economic situation, the success, 
and the outlook of the company. Compared with competitors, the compensation should be attractive, 
offering incentives to attract qualified members to the Executive Board and retain them on a long-term 
basis within the company. In addition, when determining the compensation, the complexity and importance 
of the tasks as well as the experience of the respective Executive Board member (especially with new 
appointments) and their contribution to the company’s success are taken into consideration. The variable 
performance-related compensation is measured based on the achievement of ambitious, pre-agreed 
targets; subsequent changes to performance targets or comparison parameters are not permitted. The 
compensation system aims to appropriately remunerate exceptional performance, while diminishing 
performance-related compensation when targets are not met. 
Procedure for establishing, implementing, and reviewing the compensation system 
Following preparation by the General Committee, the compensation system for the Executive Board and 
the total compensation of each member of the Executive Board is determined and regularly reviewed by 
the entire Supervisory Board. The topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and General Committee in the 
year under review are described in detail in the Supervisory Board Report.
 ► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT 
Horizontal (external) comparison 
When determining the compensation of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board takes into account 
current market compensation levels, especially among companies listed in the German share index (DAX) 
as well as other selected national and international companies in the sporting goods and textile industries. 
The Supervisory Board conducts regular horizontal comparisons to ascertain the appropriateness and 
competitiveness of the Executive Board compensation in relation to the economic situation of the 
company. In the appropriateness test carried out in the year under review, in addition to the companies 
listed in the German share index (DAX), the following national and international companies in particular 
were used for comparison purposes: Nike, Under Armour, VF, Puma, Lululemon, Skechers, Anta, H&M 
and Inditex. 
Vertical (internal) comparison 
The Supervisory Board also takes into account the company’s internal compensation structure and levels 
when determining the Executive Board compensation. In this context, the Executive Board compensation is 
compared to that of senior management and employees overall in Germany, also with regard to 
development over time.  
Pay ratios 
In the 2020 financial year, the ratio of the target direct compensation (sum of the annual fixed 
compensation and the annual bonus target amounts for the short- and long-term variable compensation) 
of the Chief Executive Officer to the target direct compensation of the senior management was 11.8 (2019: 
11.6) and of the employees overall in Germany was 81.9 (2019: 81.8). The ratio of the average target direct 
compensation of the ordinary Executive Board members to the target direct compensation of the senior 
management was 4.8 (2019: 4.6) and of the employees overall in Germany was 33.3 (2019: 32.6). 
Overall, the Supervisory Board believes that the compensation system is clear and easy to understand and 
makes use of transparent performance criteria. Due to the fact that the target direct compensation 
consists predominantly of variable components which are directly linked to the short- and long-term 
objectives of the company and due to the share-based long-term compensation of the Executive Board 
members, the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with the interests of the shareholders. The 
Supervisory Board is also of the opinion that the compensation of Executive Board members is 
appropriate.

FIXED NON-PERFORMANCE-RELATED COMPONENTS 
Fixed compensation 
The fixed compensation consists of an annual fixed salary. In principle, it is paid in twelve equal monthly 
installments and generally remains unchanged during the term of the service contract. The fixed 
compensation corresponds to 35% of the target direct compensation of the respective Executive Board 
member. 
Other benefits 
Other regular benefits for Executive Board members include payment for, or providing the monetary value 
of, non-cash benefits such as premiums or contributions to insurance schemes in line with market 
practice, the provision of a company car or the payment of a car allowance, reimbursement of costs for a 
regular health check, reimbursement of work-related moving costs, and, if Executive Board members are 
also subject to taxation abroad, the costs for the tax consultant selected by adidas. The total amount of 
other benefits is capped at 5% of the total amount of the fixed compensation and Performance Bonus 
granted in the respective financial year (‘Benefit Cap’). 
Defined contribution pension plans 
The current members of the Executive Board have defined contribution pension plans. Each year, as part 
of the pension commitments, the virtual pension account of each Executive Board member is credited with 
an amount which equals a percentage determined by the Supervisory Board and which is related to the 
Executive Board member’s individual annual fixed compensation. The appropriateness of the percentage 
is regularly assessed by the Supervisory Board. When making its decision, the Supervisory Board takes 
into account the targeted individual pension level – also based on the length of service on the Executive 
Board – and the resulting annual and long-term expenses for the company. The percentage most recently 
determined by the Supervisory Board amounts to 50%. The pension assets on the virtual pension account 
at the beginning of the respective calendar year yield a fixed interest rate of 3% p.a., however for no longer 
than until the pension benefits first become due. Entitlement to the pension benefits becomes vested 
immediately. 
Entitlements to pension benefits comprise pensions to be received upon reaching the age of 65, or, on 
application, early retirement pensions to be received upon reaching the age of 62 or disability and 
survivors’ benefits. 
On occurrence of the pension-triggering event, the pension benefits generally correspond to the balance of 
the pension account including accumulated interest on that date. In case of invalidity or death prior to 
reaching the age of 62, for the minimum coverage, the Executive Board member’s virtual pension account 
will be credited with the outstanding pension contributions for the time until the Executive Board member 
would have reached the age of 62, but for no longer than 120 months (without interest accrual). 
At the option of the Executive Board member or the surviving dependents, the payout of all pension 
benefits is made either as a one-time payment or in up to ten equal annual installments. As a rule, in case 
of a payout in annual installments, the installments are due in January of the respective year.

VARIABLE PERFORMANCE-RELATED COMPONENTS 
Performance Bonus 
As the annual variable performance-related component, the Performance Bonus serves as compensation 
for the Executive Board’s performance in the past financial year in line with the short-term development of 
the company. At the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory Board establishes the respective 
weighted performance criteria. In case of 100% target achievement, the target amount of the Performance 
Bonus corresponds to 25% of the target direct compensation of the respective Executive Board member. 
The amount of the Performance Bonus is determined based on the achievement of, generally, four 
weighted criteria. Two of these criteria are the same for all Executive Board members and are overall 
weighted at 60%. These criteria are directly linked to the annual guidance externally communicated and, at 
the same time, follow directly from the – also externally communicated – long-term growth targets of 
adidas. The other two criteria, which are also in line with the company’s short- and long-term targets and 
reflect priorities of the respective Executive Board function also taking into account non-financial aspects, 
are determined on an individual basis for the respective Executive Board member and are overall weighted 
at 40%. 
All criteria are designed in such a way that target achievement may also be zero. If the overall degree of 
target achievement (sum of all degrees of target achievement) is greater than 150%, the Performance 
Bonus Amount is limited to 150% of the individual Performance Bonus target amount. If the overall degree 
of target achievement lies at or below 50%, the Executive Board member is not entitled to the 
Performance Bonus. Therefore, the Performance Bonus may be omitted entirely if targets are clearly not 
met. 
At the end of the financial year, the precise target achievement of each Executive Board member, which is, 
in principle, based on a comparison of the predefined target values with the values achieved in the year 
under review, is assessed by the Supervisory Board (‘target/actual comparison’). The Supervisory Board 
determines the factor by which the Performance Bonus target amount is multiplied by adding up these 
degrees of target achievement (‘overall degree of target achievement’). The result is the individual amount 
of the Performance Bonus to be paid (‘Performance Bonus Amount’). When determining the degrees of 
target achievement and thus when determining the Performance Bonus Amount, the Supervisory Board 
may, at its equitable discretion in justified special cases, take into account extraordinary positive and 
negative developments which are not related to the performance of the Executive Board. If there are 
extraordinary developments that at Supervisory Board ́s equitable discretion necessitate an adjustment, 
these developments will be explained in detail and with transparency in the annual Compensation Report.  
The Performance Bonus Amount is payable following approval of the consolidated financial statements of 
the past financial year.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018/2020 (‘LTIP 2018/2020’) 
The LTIP 2018/2020 aims to link the long-term performance-related compensation of the Executive Board 
to the company’s performance and thus to the interests of the shareholders. Therefore, the 
LTIP 2018/2020 is share-based. It consists of three annual tranches (2018, 2019, and 2020), and each 
tranche is assessed based on a period of approximately four and a half years. Each of the three annual 
LTIP tranches consists of a performance year and a subsequent lock-up period of slightly more than three 
years. In case of 100% target achievement, the LTIP target amount for each of the LTIP tranches 
corresponds to 40% of the target direct compensation of the respective Executive Board member. 
At the beginning of 2018, the Supervisory Board determined for each of the three performance years 
(2018, 2019, and 2020) the absolute increase in net income from continuing operations compared to the 
respective previous year as a performance criterion. The target values for the annual LTIP tranches 
followed directly from the externally published long-term net income growth targets of the company. For 
instance, if net income from continuing operations had been increased by a total of € 630 million (100% 
target achievement) in the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, net income from continuing operations 
would have amounted to € 2,060 million in 2020. Compared to 2015 (basis of adidas’ corporate strategy 
‘Creating the New’, which ended in 2020), this would have corresponded to an average increase in net 
income of 23% per year, which would have been within the target corridor of 22% to 24%, as defined by 
adidas for the corporate strategy ‘Creating the New’.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The LTIP 2018/2020 stipulated that if the increase in net income from continuing operations is below 
€ 210 million in the respective performance year, the target value for 100% target achievement must be 
increased accordingly for the following performance year, unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise 
at its equitable discretion. However, if the increase in net income was higher than € 210 million in a 
performance year, the target for the following performance year remained unaffected. 
At the end of the performance year, the Supervisory Board assesses the precise target achievement of the 
Executive Board members, which is, in principle, based on a comparison of the predefined target value 
with the value achieved in the performance year (‘target/actual comparison’). The degree of target 
achievement by which the annual LTIP target amount determined for the respective Executive Board 
member is multiplied is derived from the amount of the actual increase in net income from continuing 
operations for the respective performance year. In this respect, the Supervisory Board may, at its 
equitable discretion in justified special cases, take into account extraordinary positive and negative 
developments which are not related to the performance of the Executive Board. If there are extraordinary 
developments that at the Supervisory Board ́s equitable discretion necessitate an adjustment, these 
developments will be explained in detail and with transparency in the annual Compensation Report. 
If the actual increase in net income from continuing operations compared to the previous year is between 
the predefined threshold values, the degree of target achievement is determined based on a sliding scale. 
If the annual increase in net income is below € 140 million, the degree of target achievement is zero. 
Consequently, the LTIP Bonus for the respective LTIP tranche is omitted completely. Furthermore, the 
degree of target achievement is capped at 150%, even if the increase in net income exceeds € 280 million.

≥ + € 280 million  150% 
+ € 210 million  100% 
+ € 140 million  50% 
< + € 140 million  0% 
 
By multiplying the degree of target achievement thus calculated with the annual LTIP target amount 
determined for the respective Executive Board member based on 100% target achievement, the Grant 
Amount is determined, which is paid out to the Executive Board member for the respective annual 
LTIP tranche following the approval of the consolidated financial statements for the performance year. The 
Executive Board members have to invest the full Grant Amount which remains after deducting applicable 
taxes and social security contributions (‘LTIP Payout Amount’) into the acquisition of adidas AG shares. The 
shares purchased are subject to a lock-up period. The lock-up period ends in the third financial year after 
the acquisition of the shares upon expiry of the month in which the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG 
takes place. The Executive Board members may only dispose of the shares after expiry of the lock-up 
period.

Due to this mechanism, the compensation which the Executive Board members eventually receive from 
each of the LTIP tranches is also directly dependent on the share price performance during the respective 
lock-up period of slightly more than three years and is thus dependent on the long-term performance of 
the company. The Executive Board members are entitled to any dividends distributed in connection with 
these shares during the lock-up period. 
Furthermore, to ensure sustainable management and development of the company, the terms and 
conditions of the LTIP 2018/2020 contain malus and clawback provisions; until expiry of the lock-up period 
(malus) and beyond (clawback), these provisions allow the Supervisory Board at its equitable discretion, 
under certain circumstances, to partially or completely reduce the compensation from the LTIP 2018/2020 
or to reclaim part or all of the variable compensation already paid. Such circumstances are, for instance, 
material misstatements in the financial reports, serious compliance violations and violations of duty as 
well as breaches of the company-internal rules of conduct by the Executive Board member which, in any 
such case, would lead to an unjustified bonus payment in the context of the LTIP 2018/2020. Moreover, in 
the event of violations of duty by Executive Board members, the respective claims for damages under 
stock corporation law are applicable.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The compensation system for the Executive Board allows the Supervisory Board, at its equitable discretion 
and in rare, justified special cases, to grant a special bonus in case of extraordinary performance by an 
Executive Board member. If such special bonus is granted, it is capped at a maximum of 100% of the 
annual fixed compensation of the financial year for which the special bonus is granted. If a special bonus is 
granted, it is reported in detail and with transparency in the annual Compensation Report. 
Share ownership 
40% of the target direct compensation of the Executive Board members is granted based on the long-term 
performance-related compensation component LTIP 2018/2020. To promote sustainable development of 
the company, the Executive Board members are obligated in the context of the LTIP 2018/2020 to invest 
the full Payout Amount into the acquisition of adidas AG shares. The shares purchased are subject to a 
lock-up period of slightly more than three years. If an LTIP Bonus is granted annually, the number of 
adidas AG shares directly held by the Executive Board members increases on an annual basis to a multiple 
of their fixed compensation.  
Commitments to Executive Board members upon termination of tenure 
Unless otherwise agreed upon in the individual case, if the service contract ends upon the Executive Board 
member reaching the age of 65 or upon non-renewal of the service contract, the Executive Board member 
is entitled to receive annual fixed compensation on a pro rata basis up to the date on which they leave 
office as well as a potential prorated Performance Bonus and a potential prorated LTIP Bonus.
13 
In 
principle, Executive Board members are furthermore subject to a post-contractual competition prohibition 
of two years. As consideration, for the duration of the competition prohibition, the Executive Board 
members generally receive a monthly compensation amount totaling 50% of the monthly fixed 
compensation last received, subject to offsetting (e.g. of income from other use of their work capacity). If 
the departed Executive Board member receives pension payments from the company, this compensation 
is offset against any pension benefits owed by the company during the period of the competition 
prohibition. 
In case of premature termination of tenure in the absence of good cause, the Executive Board service 
contracts cap potential severance payments at a maximum of twice the total annual compensation, not 
exceeding payment claims for the remaining period of the service contract (‘Severance Payment Cap’). If 
the service contract is terminated due to a change of control, a possible severance payment is limited to 
150% of the Severance Payment Cap. The Executive Board member does not receive a severance payment 
if they terminate tenure prematurely at their own request or if there is good cause for the company to 
terminate the employment relationship. The service contracts concluded with Executive Board members 
newly appointed with effect from January 1, 2020, generally stipulate that compensation for periods of 
competition prohibition possibly paid on a monthly basis to departing Executive Board members is offset 
against any severance payments potentially paid by adidas. 
Sideline activities of Executive Board members 
Executive Board members may only take on sideline activities with or without remuneration, in particular 
supervisory board mandates in group-external companies, with the prior approval of the Supervisory 
Board. Group-internal mandates are deemed covered by the contractually agreed Executive Board 
compensation. The Supervisory Board decides whether or not compensation for group-external mandates 
is credited to the Executive Board compensation. 
► SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD 
 
13 In the case of Executive Board member Roland Auschel, the company has agreed upon a follow-up bonus of 75% of the Performance Bonus granted to him 
for the last full financial year. This follow-up bonus is payable in two tranches, twelve and 24 months following the end of the contract.

EXECUTIVE BOARD COMPENSATION 2020 
2020 Performance Bonus 
As in previous years, for the 2020 financial year, the Supervisory Board has in general determined the 
following performance criteria: 
─ currency-neutral sales growth, 
─ an increase in the operating margin and 
─ two criteria relating to the individual performance of the Executive Board members. 
The Performance Bonus targets determined were based on the company forecast communicated at the 
beginning of the 2020 financial year before the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. When setting 
the targets for the 2020 financial year, the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming 
apparent and mainly affecting the operating business in Asia, especially in Greater China. Under these 
circumstances, the Supervisory Board decided that the operating business in Greater China should not be 
taken into account when determining the criteria and targets for the 2020 Performance Bonus. At the 
same time, to strengthen the market position in the important chinese market, the Supervisory Board set 
an additional performance criterion for the Executive Board – aimed at increasing market shares in 
Greater China compared to the previous year – and adjusted the weighting of each performance criterion 
accordingly.

The shared and individual criteria established at the beginning of the financial year were not adjusted 
during the financial year in light of further developments of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the 
unforeseeable, serious impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on the company, the targets and the 
target values for the 2020 Performance Bonus set by the Supervisory Board at the beginning of the 
financial year did not adequately reflect the actual course of business. The achievement of the shared 
financial targets (currency-neutral sales growth and increase in operating margin) was 0% in each case, 
while the target achievement for the increase in market shares in Greater China was 100%. The 
achievement of the individual targets varied considerably from 0% to 123%, which is attributable in 
particular to the different degrees of impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the respective individual 
criteria, which could not be considered adequately at the time of target setting. For example, the target 
achievement for Roland Auschel's individual criterion ‘success of the direct-to-consumer business‘ was 
0% despite a very successful increase in e-commerce sales (currency-neutral net sales growth of 53% 
compared to the previous year), as the material revenue decline in the physical sales channels could only 
partially be offset. The same applies to the target achievement of Harm Ohlmeyer's individual criterion 
‘cost management‘, as operating overhead expenses increased as a percentage of sales, although the 
company's liquidity situation was stabilized in the course of the coronavirus pandemic also due to a very 
successful cost discipline. 
Due to the inadequately set performance criteria in view of the unforeseeable impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic, the minimum overall degree of target achievement of over 50% required for a payout was only 
achieved by some of the Executive Board members.

As a liquidity management measure, the Executive Board had already decided in April 2020 to waive the 
Performance Bonus for the 2020 financial year. As a result, a Performance Bonus will also not be paid to 
those Executive Board members who have achieved an overall target achievement of over 50%. 
LTIP 2018/2020: Performance year 2020 
In the 2018 financial year, the Supervisory Board determined as a performance criterion for each of the 
three performance years (2018, 2019, and 2020) the absolute increase in net income from continuing 
operations compared to the respective previous year.  
At the time the targets were set for the 2020 financial year, the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic 
was becoming apparent and mainly affecting the operating business in Asia, especially in Greater China. 
Under these circumstances, the Supervisory Board decided that the operating business in Greater China 
should not be taken into account when determining the target value for the 2020 LTIP tranche. The annual 
performance criterion ‘absolute increase in net income from continuing operations’ was therefore set at a 
target value of € 170 million (instead of € 210 million).

Special bonus 
The compensation system for the Executive Board allows the Supervisory Board, at its equitable discretion 
and in rare, justified special cases, to grant a special bonus in case of extraordinary performance by an 
Executive Board member. If such special bonus is granted, it is capped at a maximum of 100% of the 
annual fixed compensation of the financial year for which the special bonus is granted. 
Due to the unforeseeable, serious impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on the company, the target 
values for the 2020 Performance Bonus and 2020 LTIP tranche set by the Supervisory Board at the 
beginning of the financial year did not adequately reflect the actual course of business. The target values 
were not adjusted during the financial year despite further developments of the coronavirus pandemic. As 
a result, the target values set by the Supervisory Board at the beginning of the financial year could 
predominantly not be met by the Executive Board members. Furthermore, as a liquidity management 
measure, the Executive Board had already decided in April 2020 to waive the 2020 Performance Bonus and 
the 2020 LTIP Bonus. Against this background, the 2020 Performance Bonus will also not be paid to those 
Executive Board members who have achieved an overall target achievement of over 50%. 
In the Supervisory Board's opinion, all members of the Executive Board have demonstrated outstanding 
performance in leading the company in times of the coronavirus pandemic with a sole focus on the long-
term prosperity of adidas and the health of its global employees, consumers and partners. Not only were 
coronavirus pandemic-related employee layoffs avoided entirely, the company's liquidity position was also 
stabilized due to strict cost discipline and a strong increase in the share of e-commerce sales through 
consistent investment in digital capabilities and marketing. Furthermore, following a series of successful 
financing activities, the syndicated revolving loan facility with the participation of the state-owned 
development bank KfW was redeemed ahead of schedule in November 2020. The € 500 million share of 
the loan utilized in July 2020 was repaid in October 2020 including agreed-upon market interest and fees. 
At the same time, the share price of adidas AG has stabilized again and at € 297.90 at the end of the year 
under review (Xetra closing price as at December 30, 2020) was back at the level before the start of the 
coronavirus pandemic. In addition, in view of the stabilization of the liquidity situation and management's 
confidence in the company's long-term growth potential, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of 
adidas AG intend to propose to the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2021 a dividend of € 3.00 per 
dividend-entitled share for the 2020 financial year. Against this background, the Supervisory Board 
considers it appropriate to grant a special bonus for the first time to the Executive Board members 
incumbent as at December 31, 2020.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The special bonus is payable following approval of the 2020 consolidated financial statements and 
amounts to 25% of the LTIP target amount determined for the 2020 financial year for each Executive Board 
member. This establishes consistency with the granting of an LTIP Bonus to senior management in the 
corresponding amount of 25%. The special bonus is granted share-based and shall therefore be invested 
by the Executive Board members into the acquisition of adidas AG shares after deduction of applicable 
taxes and social security contributions in full. The shares purchased are subject to a lock-up period of 
slightly more than three years which ends upon expiry of the month in which the Annual General Meeting 
of adidas AG for the 2024 financial year takes place. As a result, the special bonus granted to the members 
of the Executive Board is also aligned with the performance of the company and thus with the interests of 
the shareholders. 
The granting of the special bonus represents an absolutely exceptional case in light of the unprecedented 
and serious impact of the coronavirus pandemic, in order to ensure fair and equal treatment of the 
members of the Executive Board. This approach follows the overall concept of the company to grant its 
employees worldwide a bonus payment that is appropriate in view of all circumstances for their 
outstanding performance in the 2020 financial year.

1 As a liquidity management measure, the Executive Board had already decided in April 2020 to waive the Performance Bonus and LTIP Bonus for the 2020 financial year. 
2 The Grant Amount which remains for the respective annual LTIP tranche after deduction of applicable taxes and social security contributions (‘LTIP Payout Amount’) must be invested in the 
acquisition of adidas AG shares. These shares are subject to a lock-up period which ends in the third financial year after the acquisition of the shares upon expiry of the month in which the 
Annual General Meeting of adidas AG takes place. The LTIP Payout Amount is considered earned only after expiry of the lock-up period and only then can the Executive Board members dispose 
of the shares at their own discretion. By contrast, the amount deducted for income tax and social security contributions is already fully earned at the time of payout following the adoption of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Supervisory Board. As a liquidity management measure, the Executive Board had already decided in April 2020 to waive the LTIP Bonus for the 2020 
financial year. This means that Executive Board members will not acquire any adidas AG shares in the context of the 2020 LTIP tranche. 
3 First-time granting of a special bonus to members of the Executive Board incumbent as at December 31, 2020 for their outstanding performance in leading the company in times of the 
coronavirus pandemic. The special bonus amounts to 25% of the LTIP target amount determined for the 2020 financial year for each Executive Board member. The special bonus is granted 
share-based and shall therefore be invested into the acquisition of adidas AG shares after deducting applicable taxes and social security contributions. The shares purchased are subject to a 
lock-up period which ends upon expiry of the month in which the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG for the 2024 financial year takes place. The Payout Amount of the special bonus is 
considered earned only after expiry of the lock-up period and only then can the Executive Board members dispose of the shares at their own discretion. By contrast, the amount deducted for 
income tax and social security contributions is already fully earned at the time of payout following the adoption of the consolidated financial statements by the Supervisory Board. 
4 The compensation components outlined above constitute the overall payments to be set out individually in accordance with commercial law both in the 2020 financial year and in the previous 
year. 
5 Contractually agreed upon Performance Bonus target amount 2020 and LTIP bonus target amount 2018/2020 (2020 tranche) due to intra-year appointment of Brian Grevy (with effect from 
February 1, 2020) to the Executive Board. Service costs 2020 stated pro rata temporis. Brian Grevy additionally received a compensation for a bonus forfeited at his former employer in the 
amount of € 1,000,000. 
6 Contractually agreed upon Performance Bonus target amount 2019 and LTIP bonus target amount 2018/2020 (2019 tranche) due to the intra-year appointment of Martin Shankland (with 
effect from March 4, 2019) to the Executive Board. Service costs 2019 stated pro rata temporis. 
7 Executive Board compensation stated pro rata temporis due to intra-year termination of Karen Parkin’s Executive Board mandate. Due to her departure, Karen Parkin additionally received a 
contractually agreed upon severance payment in the amount of € 5,341,367. This compensation is set out in the Compensation Report in the overall payments to former Executive Board 
members. 
8 Due to his departure, Eric Liedtke additionally received a contractually agreed upon severance payment in the amount of € 5,428,572. This compensation is set out in the Compensation 
Report in the overall payments to former Executive Board members for the 2019 financial year. 
9 Executive Board compensation stated pro rata temporis due to the intra-year termination of Gil Steyaert’s Executive Board mandate. Gil Steyaert’s service contract terminated with effect 
from February 28, 2019. Until that date, Gil Steyaert was paid his full monthly fixed salary. Due to his departure, Gil Steyaert additionally received a contractually agreed upon severance 
payment in the amount of € 3,422,316. This compensation also comprises the services costs stated herein and is set out in the Compensation Report in the overall payments to former 
Executive Board members for the 2019 financial year. For Gil Steyaert, the service costs 2019 comprised the gross contribution contractually agreed upon due to his departure which was 
granted to Gil Steyaert as pension benefits payable until May 31, 2020 for an early termination of the Executive Board mandate. Due to the adjustment of Gil Steyaert’s pension commitment in 
the 2018 financial year, the service costs corresponded to the gross contribution credited by adidas AG for the respective financial year to the special account opened for him.

Commitments to Executive Board members upon termination of tenure 
Termination of Karen Parkin’s tenure effective June 30, 2020:  
In connection with the termination of her Executive Board mandate, Karen Parkin received a severance 
payment of € 5,341,367. 
As regards the post-contractual competition prohibition, Karen Parkin has received monthly compensation 
to the amount of € 37,500 since July 1, 2020, payable for a total period of 24 months. This corresponds to 
50% of the last fixed monthly salary. If the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition 
prohibition and any potential income from other employment in total exceed the monthly fixed salary last 
received by Karen Parkin before her departure, any income from other employment will be offset against 
the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition prohibition. The overall maximum 
compensation for the post-contractual competition prohibition payable to Karen Parkin therefore amounts 
to € 900,000. 
Overall payments to former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents 
In the 2020 financial year, overall payments to former members of the Executive Board and their surviving 
dependents amounted to € 10.641 million (2019: € 14.567 million). 
Provisions were created for pension entitlements for former members of the Executive Board who 
resigned on or before December 31, 2005 and their surviving dependents, amounting to € 45.799 million in 
total as at December 31, 2020 (2019: € 46.326 million). There are pension commitments toward six former 
Executive Board members who resigned after December 31, 2005, which are covered by a pension fund or 
a pension fund in combination with a reinsured pension trust fund. From this, indirect obligations 
amounting to € 48.549 million (2019: € 46.216 million) arise for adidas AG, for which no provisions were 
created due to financing through the pension fund and pension trust fund. For two former members of the 
Executive Board who resigned on or before December 31, 2019, there are pension commitments 
amounting to € 3.971 million. 
Miscellaneous 
The Executive Board members do not receive any additional compensation for mandates within adidas. 
The Executive Board members have not received any loans or advance payments from adidas AG. 
Furthermore, no Executive Board member received any payments or promises of payments from third 
parties with regard to their work at adidas.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
COMPENSATION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS 
The compensation system that has been applicable for the members of the Supervisory Board since 
July 1, 2017 was adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2017. The 
compensation system is set out in § 18 of the Articles of Association of adidas AG. 
COMPENSATION SYSTEM 
With respect to the monitoring and advising of the Executive Board, the compensation received by 
Supervisory Board members reflects the responsibility involved as well as their individual workload and 
time required. When determining the compensation, particular consideration is given to ensure that it is 
appropriate and in line with current market levels in order to attract suitable candidates, also in an 
international context. This contributes to the execution of the corporate strategy and promotes the long-
term development of the company. 
The compensation for Supervisory Board members consists of a fixed compensation for their work on the 
Supervisory Board (‘base amount’) and an additional compensation for committee work. The Supervisory 
Board members are not granted performance-related compensation. In addition, the Supervisory Board 
members receive attendance fees and are reimbursed for expenses they incur in their role. 
Compensation for Supervisory Board function 
Each Supervisory Board member receives fixed compensation for their work on the Supervisory Board, 
which is paid following the end of the respective financial year. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and 
his two deputies receive higher fixed compensation in light of their additional responsibilities.

Additional compensation for membership in a committee 
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members receive additional compensation for membership in certain 
committees; in this regard, too, compensation is increased if the chairmanship of a committee is assumed. 
The amount of the respective additional compensation is based on the base amount determined for the 
Supervisory Board members and depends on the tasks and responsibilities connected with the respective 
committee membership.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The compensation paid for a committee chairmanship also covers the membership in such a committee. 
The members of the Steering Committee, the Mediation Committee, the Nomination Committee, and 
committees which are established ad hoc do not receive additional compensation. If a Supervisory Board 
member is a member of more than one committee, the member only receives compensation for their 
function in the committee with the highest compensation. 
Reduced compensation in case of membership for part of financial year 
If a member belongs to the Supervisory Board or a committee for only part of a financial year, the fixed 
compensation for Supervisory Board membership and additional compensation for membership in a 
committee are reduced accordingly on a pro rata temporis basis. 
Attendance fee 
For each personal attendance of meetings of the Supervisory Board and/or its committees requiring such 
personal attendance, Supervisory Board members receive an additional attendance fee of € 1,000. 
Members of committees that are formed on an ad hoc basis do not receive an attendance fee. If several 
meetings take place on one day, the attendance fee is only paid once. 
Expenses 
The Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for necessary expenses and travel expenses incurred in 
connection with their mandates as well as for the VAT potentially payable on their compensation or 
reimbursement of expenses.
 
SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATION 2020 
Fixed compensation and attendance fee 
The total compensation paid to the Supervisory Board in the 2020 financial year amounted to € 2.20 million 
(2019: € 2.20 million). In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Supervisory Board members 
decided to donate 30% of this compensation to SOS Children’s Villages and other good causes. In addition, 
attendance fees totaling € 28,000 (2019: € 167,000) were paid. The considerable reduction in attendance 
fees is due to the fact that the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were mostly held 
virtually in order to protect the persons involved during the coronavirus pandemic.  
Miscellaneous 
The Supervisory Board members have not received any loans or advance payments from adidas AG.

adidas share in line with DAX 30 
In 2020, global stock markets ended a very volatile year with mixed results. Fears around the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic, especially during the first half of the year, were addressed by governments through 
various monetary measures. As a result, the DAX 30 was up 4%, while the EURO STOXX 50 decreased by 
5%. The MSCI World Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Index closed the year with a 21% increase.
 The 
adidas AG share closed the year at € 297.90 and thus 3% above the prior year-end level.
 
Level 1 ADR outperforms common stock 
Our Level 1 ADR closed 2020 at US $ 182.99, representing an increase of 12% versus the prior year level 
(2019: US $ 162.80). The more pronounced increase of the Level 1 ADR price compared to the ordinary 
share price was due to the depreciation of the US dollar versus the euro in 2020. The number of Level 1 
ADRs outstanding decreased to 8.9 million at year-end 2020 compared to 10.4 million at the end of 2019. 
The average daily trading volume increased to around 55,500 ADRs in 2020 (2019: around 43,000). Further

adidas intends to resume dividend payments 
At the beginning of 2020, the adidas AG Executive and Supervisory Boards intended to recommend paying 
a dividend of € 3.85 per dividend-entitled share to shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, as 
a result of the strong operational and financial performance in 2019, the company’s robust financial 
position, and Management’s confidence in our long-term growth aspirations. In April 2020, adidas then 
took decisive steps to safeguard the company’s financial flexibility to bridge the unprecedented situation 
caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. The decision to take on a syndicated revolving loan facility 
under the participation of KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank, resulted in a de facto 
suspension of dividend payments for the duration of the facility. The syndicated loan was fully replaced in 
November 2020.  
The adidas AG Executive Board decided in February 2021 to resume the company’s dividend payments. 
Subject to the approval by the Supervisory Board, the company will propose paying a dividend of € 3.00 per 
dividend-entitled share for the financial year 2020 to adidas shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on May 12, 2021. The dividend proposal, which reflects the company’s strengthened financial profile as 
well as Management’s positive outlook for the current year, would result in a total dividend payout of 
€ 585 million.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020  
The decision follows a series of financing measures, including obtaining strong investment-grade ratings, 
issuing bonds worth € 1.5 billion and securing a new syndicated loan of € 1.5 billion with partner banks, 
that adidas had successfully completed throughout the past year.  
adidas stops share buyback program in March 2020 
As a result of the high level of economic uncertainty caused by the dynamic developments related to the 
coronavirus outbreak especially during the first half of the year, the adidas Executive Board decided to 
proactively adopt a conservative approach to liquidity management. In order to preserve the company’s 
financial flexibility in this environment, the company halted the share buyback program. After already 
temporarily suspending the 2020 tranche of its current multi-year share buyback program on March 17, 
2020, immediately after retail closures across Europe and North America started to come into effect, the 
Executive Board decided on March 31, 2020, to formally stop the repurchasing of adidas shares for the 
remainder of the year. Consequently, the company did not deploy the amount of up to € 1.0 billion that was 
initially planned for the repurchase of own shares in 2020. Between January 7, 2020, and March 16, 2020, 
the company bought back 1.0 million shares, corresponding to 0.48% of the company’s stock capital, for a 
consideration of € 257 million. The average purchase price per share was € 269.19. A total of 8.8 million 
treasury shares have been canceled since the start of the current program, reducing the company’s share 
count and stock capital correspondingly.  
Strong international investor base 
Based on our share register, we estimate that adidas AG currently has more than 115,000 shareholders 
(2019: more than 90,000). In our latest ownership analysis conducted in January 2021, we identified almost 
100% of our shares outstanding. Institutional investors represent the largest investor group, holding 86% 
of shares outstanding (2019: 89%). Private investors and undisclosed holdings account for 11% (2019: 9%). 
Lastly, adidas AG currently holds 3% of the company’s shares as treasury shares (2019: 2%).

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
STRATEGY 
With sport playing an increasingly important role in more and more peoples’  lives, both on and off the 
field of play, we operate in a highly attractive industry. Based on our deep understanding of our 
consumer and the authenticity of the adidas brand, we push the boundaries of products, experiences 
and services. We do so according to our strategy, which allows us to fully capitalize on the acceleration 
of favorable long-term structural trends.  
Review of strategy: ‘Creating the New’ 
‘Creating the New’ was our strategy for the period from 2015 to 2020. Our ambition to drive top- and 
bottom-line growth by significantly increasing brand desirability was at the core of ‘Creating the New’ – a 
strategy that proved to be very successful.  
We were firmly on track to deliver on our 2020 financial ambition, having raised our targets twice during 
the strategic cycle. This is reflected by the company’s results for the period from 2015 to 2019, prior to the 
coronavirus pandemic: 
 
─ Net sales: Currency-neutral net sales increased at a rate of 12% per annum on average between 2015 
and 2019, in line with our ambition from March 2018 of between 10% and 12% between 2015 and 2020 
(initial ambition from March 2015 was high-single-digit growth). 
─ Operating margin: Reached a level of 11.3% in 2019, in line with our ambition from March 2018 of up to 
11.5% by 2020 (initial ambition from March 2015 was around 10%). 
─ Net income from continuing operations: Grew at a rate of 28% per annum on average between 2015 
and 2019, ahead of our ambition from March 2018 of between 22% and 24% between 2015 and 2020 
(initial ambition from March 2015 was around 15%). 
Ultimately, the financial ambitions for 2020 were not met due to the impact of the global coronavirus 
pandemic. Aside from financials, we executed on the three strategic choices of ‘Creating the New’ as 
introduced in March 2015 – Speed, Cities, and Open Source – all the way to the finish line of the strategic 
cycle. As a result, we not only established new iconic product franchises, such as Ultraboost and NMD, but 
also built and scaled innovative capabilities, many of which did not previously exist in our industry. These 
include the groundbreaking partnerships with Parley for the Oceans and Carbon, the creative 
collaborations with Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé, the shortening of lead times through 
speed-enabled ranges, and the creation of end-to-end consumer ecosystems in global megacities.  
The execution of our Creating the New ‘Acceleration Plan’, which was introduced in March 2017, yielded 
the profitability turnaround of Reebok and the divestiture of CCM Hockey, the significant strengthening of 
adidas’ positioning in North America, the relentless standardization of processes under ONE adidas, and 
the successful digital transformation of our company. The latter resulted in overproportionate growth in 
the company’s e-com business, which generated more than € 4 billion in net sales in 2020 – more than 
twice the initial ambition from March 2015. 
The many achievements resulting from these initiatives form the foundation upon which we have built our 
new strategy   for the period until 2025, grounded in our purpose, mission, and attitude.

Our purpose: Through sport, we have the power to change lives 
We will always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to include and unite people in sport and to 
create a more sustainable world.  
Our mission: To be the best sports brand in the world 
We are the best when we are the credible, inclusive, and sustainable leader with a first or second position 
regarding market share in each strategic category in the long term.  
Our attitude: Impossible is nothing 
We are rebellious optimists driven by action, with a desire to shape a better future together. We see the 
world of sport and culture with possibility where others only see the impossible.  
New strategy ‘Own the Game’ for the period until 2025 
‘Own the Game’ is our strategy that guides us through to 2025 – a plan rooted in sport. Sport is adidas’ 
past, present and future. ‘Own the Game’ puts the consumer at the heart of everything we do and is 
brought to life by our people. Our strategic focus is on increasing brand credibility, elevating the 
experience for our consumer and pushing the boundaries in sustainability. The execution of our strategy is 
enabled by a mindset of innovation across all dimensions of our business as well as our digital 
transformation. We own the game and will drive significant growth.  
‘Own the Game’ is our strategy for the period until 2025 
 
 
 
Consumer 
Our consumers are at the heart of ‘Own the Game’. Consumers drive structural trends in our industry 
through their preferences and behaviors. They strive to live active and healthy lives, they wish to blend 
sport and lifestyle, and they are digital by default as well as sustainable by conviction. ‘Own the Game’ will 
be ready to capture those consumer-driven opportunities and carve out new ones for their benefit. In 2025, 
‘Own the Game’ will not only have delivered overproportionate growth for adidas, but also deepened 
relationships with our consumer, as we continue to actively live our purpose ‘through sport, we have the 
power to change lives.’

People 
To successfully deliver on our five-year strategy, we will support our people to truly own the game. We will 
make sure we have the relevant capabilities to tackle our business needs and seize opportunities as we 
attract, grow and retain talent. We will ensure there is a level playing field for all as we continue our 
diversity and inclusion journey. Furthermore, we will leverage our unique workplace that has the 
consumer at the heart of everything we do.  
Credibility 
We are a leading brand thanks to our credibility in both sport and culture. To continue to excite our 
consumers with innovative concepts that support our mission, we will sharpen our brand, refine our 
product offering and leverage partnerships to further enhance our credibility with consumers.
 
─ Sport: We will focus on the most important sport categories: Football, Training, Running, and Outdoor. 
Football is the biggest sport in terms of viewership, while Running, Training, and Outdoor are the 
biggest participation sports. Our products in these categories are built for sport and worn for sport.  
─ Lifestyle: To tap into the biggest commercial opportunity for our brand, we will sharpen our brand 
architecture by introducing a new consumer proposition called Sportswear. These products are born 
from sport and worn for style. At the same time, we will extend Originals, which is inspired by sport 
and worn on the street, into the premium segment through top-quality manufacturing processes and 
materials. 
─ Women: We will execute on a cross-category plan to achieve product excellence and elevate the 
women’s experience through our membership program to become her indispensable sports brand. Our 
goal is to grow currency-neutral net sales for our Women’s business at a mid-teens rate per annum on 
average until 2025, thereby significantly increasing the Women’s share of our overall business. 
─ Partnerships: We will amplify our credibility through our partnerships by leveraging their power, 
authenticity, and reach. We will expand our portfolio of partners, which already includes Beyoncé, 
Kanye West, Stella McCartney and Pharrell Williams, all of whom will continue to play a significant role 
in wowing our consumer on the lifestyle side. Likewise, we will continue to leverage our partnerships 
with the biggest symbols in sport, be it with teams like Bayern Munich or Real Madrid, athletes like 
Lionel Messi or Mikaela Shiffrin, or events like the Boston and Berlin Marathons.  
Experience 
To grow long-term relationships with our consumer, we excite and empower them by creating 
personalized experiences in both digital and physical spaces. With this in mind, we will accelerate our 
transformation into a direct-to-consumer-led (DTC-led) business built around membership. 
─ Membership: With the launch of our membership program in 2018, we laid the foundation for offering 
personalized experiences to our most valuable consumers. We are now ready to take this to the next 
level with the goal of increasing our member base to around 500 million by 2025. Through 
membership, we reward engagement and purchasing activity by offering exclusive hype products, 
access to launches and special events, and more. 
─ DTC-led: E-com continues to be our most important store. Both adidas.com and the adidas app will 
see enhancements across the entire consumer journey. By 2025, our e-com business is expected to 
account for between € 8 billion and € 9 billion of our company’s net sales. While e-com is the pinnacle 
of our retail strategy, our physical stores will continue to play a crucial role in creating a physical and 
emotional connection with our brand. Retail formats will be digitized with fully-fledged omnichannel 
capabilities. The DTC business, comprising our e-com as well as our physical stores, is projected to

account for around half of the company’s net sales by 2025. We will also continue to leverage our 
strong relationships with strictly selected wholesale partners and ‘win-with-the-winners’ to ensure a 
holistic experience for the consumer no matter the point of sale. 
─ Key Cities: We are building on our Key Cities portfolio of London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, 
Shanghai and Tokyo, by adding Mexico City, Berlin, Moscow, Dubai, Beijing and Seoul. These cities 
represent the beating heart of our global consumer experience and exert influence on the rest of the 
world, while at the same time offering commercial opportunities as urbanization continues. 
─ Strategic markets: We will double down on Greater China, North America and EMEA to bring exciting 
consumer experiences to life, pursuing a tailored approach that appeals to local trends. Our ambition 
is to gain market share in all three strategic markets. 
Sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability is truly holistic and deeply embedded into how we have done business 
for over two decades. Its rooted in our purpose that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. As 
we continue to pioneer in sustainability, we will move from strong stand-alone initiatives to a scaled and 
comprehensive sustainability program.  
─ What we offer: We keep pushing the boundaries of our sustainable offering, so that our consumer will 
be able to choose from a uniquely comprehensive range. By 2025, nine out of ten of our articles will be 
sustainable. How we will do this revolves around how we expand and innovate our 3-loops: made from 
recycled materials, made to be remade, or made with natural and renewable materials. We define 
products as sustainable when they show environmental benefits versus conventional products due to 
the materials used or their respective production technologies. 
─ What we do: We are committed to reducing the CO2 footprint of our product offerings as we work to 
reach climate neutrality by 2050. We will achieve this through initiatives such as driving zero-carbon 
within our own operations and promoting environmental programs along our entire value chain in 
close cooperation with our suppliers.  
─ What we say: We will be vocal about our efforts that focus on creating low-impact products that are 
made to be remade. To guide our consumer to make more sustainable choices, we will also simplify 
our labelling strategy and scale up our product takeback program.
 
Innovation and Digital 
Two enablers will set us up for success. The first is applying a mindset of deep and broad innovation 
across all dimensions of our business. The second is using the speed and agility of Digital throughout our 
entire value chain. These enablers will be particularly powerful when it comes to executing on the three 
strategic focus areas – Credibility, Experience, and Sustainability – that support us in intensifying our focus 
on the consumer and driving growth.
 
Financial ambition for 2025 
‘Own the Game’ is designed to yield growth in terms of revenue, profitability and cash generation, which in 
turn creates long-term value for our shareholders. Therefore, we are focused on rigorously driving 
execution and managing all of the factors under our control, which will enable us to: 
─ Achieve top-line growth above industry average: We aim to increase currency-neutral revenue at a 
rate of between 8% and 10% per annum on average in the four-year period between 2021 and 2025.

─ Further expand both gross and operating margin: We expect to expand our gross margin to a level of 
between 53% and 55% and our operating margin to a level of between 12% and 14% by 2025. 
─ Grow our bottom-line sustainably: We plan to grow our net income from continuing operations by an 
average of between 16% and 18% per annum in the four-year period between 2021 and 2025. 
─ Invest into future organic growth: We are committed to reinvesting between 3% and 4% of net sales 
into our business by means of annual capital expenditure. 
─ Deliver attractive cash return to shareholders: Based on the material growth in terms of revenue and 
profitability, we will generate substantial cumulative free cash flow until 2025. The majority of it – 
between € 8 billion and € 9 billion – will be made available and distributed to shareholders through a 
consistent dividend pay-out in a range between 30% and 50% of net income from continuing 
operations, complemented by share buybacks.  
Given the prevailing uncertainties related to the further development of the coronavirus pandemic, our 
financial ambition for 2025 has 2021 – rather than 2020 – as a baseline. However, this does not apply to the 
strategy as such, which will be executed throughout the entire five-year strategic cycle. 
As a global leader in our industry with a strong strategy in place, we are very well positioned for the years 
ahead.

GLOBAL BRANDS 
THE CONSUMER AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO 
Global Brands oversees the innovation, design, development and marketing of the company’s sports and 
lifestyle offerings. By constantly developing desirable products and providing inspiring experiences, the 
function strives to build a strong image as well as trust and loyalty with consumers to capitalize on growth 
opportunities in the sporting goods industry.  
adidas brand 
The adidas brand has a long history and deep-rooted connection with sport. Its broad and diverse portfolio 
in both the Sport Performance and Sport Inspired categories ranges from major global sports to regional 
heartbeat sports and local sneaker culture. This has enabled the brand to transcend cultures and become 
one of the most recognized and iconic, on and off the field of play. adidas is positioned as a premium 
sportswear brand that caters to all, from elite professional athletes and teams to any individual who wants 
to make sport part of their lives, spanning footwear, apparel, and accessories and gear. Driven by a 
relentless pursuit of innovation as well as decades spent accumulating sports science expertise, the brand 
helps athletes of all levels to make a difference – in their game, in their life, in their world. This is 
anchored in our company’s purpose that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. In 2020, the 
adidas brand accounted for 91% of the company’s sales. 
Reebok brand 
Reebok is an American-inspired global brand with a deep fitness heritage and continues to merge its 
iconic past with new technologies that revolutionize both sports and lifestyle products. Reebok is 
positioned at the intersection of fitness and fashion as boundaries continue to blur. Reebok’s Sport 
category combines product divisions focused on specialized fitness activities such as running and training, 
with functional innovation and a focus on style. These products are at the forefront of fitness and true to 
the culture and communities that Reebok consumers train, run, and live in. Reebok’s second category, 
Classics, reinforces the brand’s deep roots in fitness and pop culture across multiple iconic silhouettes 
and trend-oriented lifestyle products. In 2020, the Reebok brand accounted for 7% of the company’s sales. 
As part of the development of its new five-year strategy, the company has decided to begin a formal 
process aimed at divesting Reebok.   
Iconic product franchises 
We are convinced that footwear has the highest influence on brand perception among product categories 
and our potential to grow market share. Access to athlete data and an archive that is unrivaled in the 
industry provide deep insights and ample opportunity to add chapters to our brands’ rich heritage. At the 
same time, we have a clear strategy to reduce the number of footwear models, putting a stronger focus on 
key franchises. These footwear franchises aim at shaping sport as well as influencing culture and are built 
to create trends, rather than follow them. Through uncompromised functionality, iconic design, and unique 
stories, they directly root from and are targeted at the athlete with the potential to be iterated and 
expanded over time. Their life cycles are tightly managed to ensure longevity and relevance. Key footwear 
franchises for the adidas brand include, among others, Ultraboost, Predator, and Superstar. On the 
apparel side, the brand continued to build out franchises such as the MyShelter Jacket, the Tiro Pant, and 
the Z.N.E. Hoodie. In 2020, key footwear franchises of the adidas brand represented at least 34% of its 
footwear business.

Brand desirability fueled by innovation and creative collaborations  
In addition to leveraging iconic product franchises, creating innovative concepts to meet the needs of 
athletes and consumers is a prerequisite to strengthening our market position in the sporting goods 
industry and a premise to being the best sports brand in the world. We remain highly committed to 
maintaining a full and innovative concept pipeline, bringing new ground-breaking technologies and 
processes to life, investing into sustainability, and exploring all possibilities of digitalization. The modern 
innovation landscape extends beyond product and increasingly requires innovation teams to consider the 
development of experiences and services, as well as the provision of greater levels of transparency and 
direct integration of our consumer through co-creation. In partnership with our Trend & Cultural Insights 
teams, foresight and trend analysis are shared on an ongoing basis, documenting shifts in society and 
culture. True to the vision of creative collaboration, our innovation approach is widely based on this open 
source mindset, which provides the starting point to build concepts of relevance.  
We seek to create value together with high-profile individuals and brands such as Beyoncé, Kanye West, 
Pharrell Williams, Yohji Yamamoto, Stella McCartney, and Prada. But we also collaborate with athletes 
and consumers, universities, and innovative companies as well as national and international governments 
and research organizations. In addition, we have been inspired by the input from knowledgeable partners 
such as BASF (e.g. Boost), Carbon (e.g. 4D), and Parley for the Oceans (e.g. Primeblue) for many years. In 
2020, we set out on a joint mission with San Francisco-based footwear start-up Allbirds to create a high-
performance sports shoe with the lowest carbon emissions by exploring innovations that span everything 
from manufacturing and supply chain to transportation methods.  
Commercialize innovations 
We believe developing industry-leading technologies, materials and consumer experiences is only one 
aspect of being an innovative leader. Equally important is the successful commercialization of those 
innovative concepts. 
Analogous to prior years, the majority of sales were generated with products newly introduced in the 
course of 2020. At the adidas brand, products launched during the year accounted for 68% of brand sales 
(2019: 77%), while only 2% of sales were generated with products introduced three or more years ago 
(2019: 3%). At the Reebok brand, 67% of footwear sales were generated by products launched in 2020 
(2019: 67%), while 11% of footwear product sales relate to products introduced three or more years ago 
(2019: 11%). 
We have a long heritage of innovation and strive to provide athletes with the best by creating high-
performance and competitive products. In 2020, we continued to serve consumers with innovative 
technologies and sustainable concepts built into our products: 
─ adidas 4D: The adidas 4D concept features midsoles crafted with light and oxygen using Digital Light 
Synthesis, a unique technology developed by Carbon, to produce high-performance footwear. The 
midsole pioneers a digital footwear component creation process that eliminates the necessity of 
traditional prototyping or molding. With the new technology, adidas brings additive manufacturing in 
the sports industry into a new dimension. In the past three years, adidas 4D has gone from a 
conceptual innovation to a running shoe made available in large quantities and multiple variations and 
will be continued to be scaled further. 
─ EnergyRODS: Our latest running technology is designed to mimic the foot’s metatarsals, which deliver 
an anatomically driven transition from heel to toe, limiting energy loss and providing a propulsive 
feeling. In comparison to carbon plates, EnergyRODS enable the foot to move more naturally and are 
featured in our pinnacle running product offer, such as the Adizero Adios Pro. Our latest adidas high-
performance running franchise is created for elite athletes and combines EnergyRODS, a responsive

foam, and a lightweight mesh upper. We celebrated the first success of the franchise when Peres 
Jepchirchir set a new half marathon world record in a women-only race in September 2020.  
─ Futurecraft.Strung: Strung is an industry-first textile and creation process that allows adidas to input 
athlete data into the precision placement of each thread on the upper of shoes. Futurecraft.Strung is 
the first product concept designed to illustrate Strung’s capability and was created to provide a new 
feeling and experience of fast short-distance running specifically. 
─ Made to be Remade: When it comes to dealing with plastic waste, just moving it to another place is the 
problem, not the solution. Therefore, we started the Futurecraft.Loop journey in 2019, as we drive 
forward our ambition to end plastic waste. In 2020, we introduced Loop Generation 3 as we took our 
latest Futurecraft.Loop shoe to consumers during adidas Creators Club Week in October, where we 
made the shoes available to the public for the first time and invited 1,500 Creators Club members to 
take part in a beta test of a specially designed digital experience through the adidas app. This was a 
cornerstone of the full commercial release of the sustainable franchise in 2021.  
In the same way, we continued the development of innovative materials to create relevant products for our 
consumers: 
─ Lightstrike: Lightstrike is a super-light EVA foam cushioning technology that provides extreme 
comfort and the perfect balance between light weight and responsiveness. It is featured across 
multiple running franchises and caters to the needs of runners at any level, from beginners to world-
class marathoners. 
─ Parley Ocean Plastic: Products made of Parley Ocean Plastic focus both on the needs of our athletes, by 
living up to their performance promise, and on the needs of the world, by helping to protect our oceans 
from plastic pollution. We have taken sustainability to the product level and continue to roll it out 
across our product portfolio. In 2020, we made more than 15 million pairs of shoes containing Parley 
Ocean Plastic, which means that by the end of 2020 adidas made in total more than 30 million pairs of 
shoes with Parley Ocean Plastic. 
─ Primeblue/Primegreen: Primeblue is a recycled technical material made in part with Parley Ocean 
Plastic – upcycled plastic waste, intercepted on remote islands, beaches, coastal communities and 
shorelines, preventing it from polluting our oceans. It is now included in some of adidas’ most iconic 
and visible performance franchises, like Ultraboost, and in the jerseys of some of the biggest leagues 
and teams in the world. Primegreen, made from recycled ingredients, is a series of high-performance 
materials targeted to end the use of virgin plastics. Both materials played a significant role in adidas 
reaching more than 70% total volume of recycled polyester at the end of 2020. 
─ RDY: RDY is an apparel performance concept that combines a series of technologies to serve for all 
weather conditions: insulating, moisture-managing COLD.RDY, breathable, air-cooling HEAT.RDY; 
wind-resistant, water-repellent WIND.RDY; waterproof, windproof RAIN.RDY; and moisture-absorbing 
AEROREADY. The concept enables simplified storytelling to the consumer and has been rolled out 
across multiple categories and products. 
Beyond innovative technologies, sustainable concepts and materials, key products and collaborations of 
the 2020 business year include: 
─ aSMC Urban Extreme: adidas x Stella McCartney represents the combination of eco-consciousness 
and sustainable fashion with performance sportswear. Urban Extreme ranges across all product 
categories and is elevated by tactical outerwear pieces combined with RDY innovations.

new pattern-cutting process to use less material and create less waste.

─ X – Ghosted: The first football boot available at scale with the integration of a dynamic carbon plate and 
a vacuum-fit experience that supports players’ explosive moves thanks to its proximity to the contours 
of the foot.  
Effective marketing investments 
An additional important building block of creating brand desirability and winning the consumer are our 
marketing investments. adidas is focused on creating inspirational and innovative concepts that drive 
consumer advocacy and build brand equity. The company historically spends almost half of its marketing 
investment on partners, with the remainder spent on brand marketing activities such as digital, 
advertising, point-of-sale and grassroots activations. In addition, the company will further consolidate and 
focus resources to create powerful brand statements overarching several categories under one narrative. 
This will be achieved by focusing on two priorities: 
─ Brand drivers: Brand campaigns are at the pinnacle of our communication strategy. They demonstrate 
the brand belief, conveying to consumers what adidas stands for and drive a consistent positioning 
globally. Furthermore, brand campaigns support brand priorities by establishing an emotional 
connection through the brand narrative. adidas also authenticates the brand in using sport moments 
as platforms to drive sports credibility by enabling athlete and event activations. Lastly, we leverage 
our partnerships, for example with Beyoncé, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams to drive brand heat and 
freshness in lifestyle through partner activation and special product executions. 
─ Commercial drivers: Product campaigns are created to focus on a specific product franchise (e.g. 
Ultraboost) or a technology platform (e.g. RDY or 4D). These campaigns are driven by a clear 
performance or style benefit and are expressed through storytelling around products’ unique selling 
propositions. Additional commercial content is driving conversion at the point of sale (in-store and 
online) by highlighting a product feature or benefit for key items, volume drivers and key franchises. 
In 2020, adidas achieved activations of sports marketing partners and entertainment influencers under 
single narratives and across categories globally:  
─ Creators Club Week: In October 2020, adidas launched its first seven-day digital festival, the ‘Creators 
Club’ Week. During the week, members saw our biggest-ever drop of exclusive and limited-edition 
shoes with more than 70 new designs making their debut over the course of the event. The week also 
featured appearances from global celebrities talking about important topics such as ending plastic 
waste, celebrating culture and innovation. To kick off the week, model Karlie Kloss launched the next 
chapter of Futurecraft.Loop and members had the chance to earn one of the 1,500 pairs available.

Throughout the week, a series of over 40 surprise raffles took place where members won unique 
creations, such as a piece of art from designer Paolina Russo or signed adidas Predator boots from 
FIFA World Cup winner Paul Pogba. 
─ #hometeam campaign: Following the emergence of covid-19, adidas pivoted in real-time to create and 
launch a brand campaign that offered help, hope and connection to the world during the pandemic. 
#hometeam was a global movement spearheaded and created by our partners and the content they 
created. Over 3,000 athletes, artists and influencers supported the moment making it the biggest-ever 
adidas campaign in terms of partner activation and involvement. #hometeam content was viewed close 
to 400 million times and is one of the most watched and positively received campaigns in the brand’s 
history. 
─ Ready for Sport: Following the success of #hometeam during the global pandemic in spring 2020, the 
‘Ready for Sport’ campaign was a motivating call and a celebration of sport. The series harnessed 
adidas’ purpose that ‘through sport we have the power to change lives’ in a co-creative approach 
seeking to reveal first-person stories of 20 of adidas’ leading athletes who shared how sport became 
their fuel during the covid-19 crisis to stay ready for the comeback of their craft, bringing joy and 
optimism to all. The campaign was launched on adidas’ owned and partner social media channels and 
was endorsed by over 1,000 adidas athletes. Overall, the ‘Ready for Sport’ campaign generated more 
than 500 million video views, becoming adidas’ most-watched social campaign to date. 
In terms of partners and athletes, while reducing the ratio of marketing spend and the number of 
partnerships, we will nonetheless continue to bring our products to the biggest stages in the world 
through: 
─ Events with global reach: FIFA Women’s World Cup, Rugby World Cup, the UEFA Champions League, 
and the Boston and Berlin Marathons, among others. 
─ High-profile teams: National association football teams of Argentina, Belgium, Colombia, Germany, 
Japan, Mexico, and Spain, as well as top football clubs such as Arsenal London, Bayern Munich, 
Flamengo Rio de Janeiro, Juventus Turin, Manchester United and Real Madrid, the New Zealand All 
Blacks in rugby, and American universities such as University of Miami, Arizona State University and 
Texas A&M University.  
─ High-profile individuals: Football stars Lionel Messi, Jürgen Klopp, Mohamed Salah, Paul Pogba, Toni 
Kroos, Heung-min Son, Vivianne Miedema and Wendie Renard. Basketball stars Candace Parker, 
Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, James Harden, and Liz Cambage; American football players Aaron

GLOBAL SALES  
TRANSFORMING THE MARKETPLACE 
Our Global Sales function drives the commercial performance of the company by converting brand desire 
into profitable and sustainable business growth. It is our ambition to deliver the best shopping experience 
within the sporting goods industry across all consumer touchpoints. We strive to transform the 
marketplace by actively shaping and accelerating the growth of our profitable and integrated trade 
network. Our objective is to establish scalable business solutions in order to deliver premium experiences, 
thereby meeting and surpassing consumer expectations with an integrated brand offering
. 
⌐ While 2020 saw a reduction of distribution points due to market consolidation and the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on retailers, we continue to leverage a consistent global framework with more than 
2,500 own-retail stores and our own e-commerce channel, our single biggest store available to consumers 
in over 50 countries. 
¬ 
Impact of the coronavirus pandemic 
The global outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020 led to a significant number of temporary store closures – 
both own and partner-operated – and a pronounced traffic reduction within the remaining store fleet, with 
a corresponding negative impact on our sales development. At the peak of the worldwide lockdown 
measures in April, more than 70% of our global store fleet were closed. Where and when possible, we 
began executing our store reopening plan in accordance with the decisions taken by local authorities. 
While store traffic remained below prior year levels, we registered an increase in conversion rates, as 
consumers that visited our stores tended to have a clearer buying intent. 
To meet the challenges we had to face in our business, we focused on e-commerce, as it was the only fully 
operational store and our fastest-growing channel. Through targeted consumer marketing, exclusive 
product launches and prioritized supply chain management we achieved an outstanding global e-
commerce sales growth in 2020. In response to this, the supply chain organization adapted capacities at 
our distribution centers to accommodate more e-commerce inventory. 
► SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS  
Within own-retail, we focused on limiting the direct impact of the crisis on employees and consumers with 
strong crisis management and a holistic approach to reopening our stores. During store closures, we 
focused on staff engagement and development through 100% virtual training sessions. Also, we deployed 
our store staff to support our e-commerce business leveraging their product knowledge to service 
consumers. With digital being on top of the agenda for 2020, we drove a rapid acceleration of digital tools 
and omnichannel services. Starting while retail stores were still closed, ‘Ship from store’ was enhanced to 
support online order fulfillment. We also leveraged our digital capabilities to allow for safe and convenient 
shopping experiences when stores began to reopen. ‘Wait less, shop more’ in our adidas app enabled 
consumers to book an appointment in store to reduce waiting time. Health and safety guidelines and 
processes were introduced to protect our staff and consumers and to ensure our consumers feel safe 
upon returning to our stores. Finally, our factory outlet stores played a critical role in reducing increased 
inventory levels, while maintaining the brand perception as well as health and safety standards.

In our wholesale channel, we radically changed the focus toward cash flow management in collaboration 
with our key accounts. We proactively managed our orderbook to make stock accessible to all channels 
and customers, in particular pure players and omni-channel accounts. We transferred physical sell-in 
meetings to remote, virtual sessions leveraging our digital tools and infrastructure. We partnered closely 
with our key accounts to build virtual sales events to increase demand for our product among consumers. 
To support our online business, team members from wholesale were temporarily reassigned to digital 
wholesale. 
Overall, the global pandemic accelerated our focus on digital and our own direct-to-consumer (DTC) 
channels. Our ‘Creators Club’ membership program more than doubled its size in 2020 and is currently 
reaching 165 million members across 15 countries, enabling us to build direct relationships with our 
consumers. Our own-retail stores are the physical touchpoint with our consumers and allow us to offer 
premium and personalized experiences, acquire new members and intensify relationships with our 
consumers. Moreover, long-term investments into strategic partnerships with our key accounts enable us 
to reach even more consumers where they shop, on- and offline.  
2020 channel mix 
⌐ We are actively driving the shift from wholesale to DTC channels. Selling directly to the consumer is 
beneficial to our top- and bottom lines and delivers deep consumer insights. In 2020, the share of DTC 
business, consisting of own-retail and e-commerce sales, increased significantly to 41% (2019: 33%). 
Wholesale accounted for 59% of total net sales (2019: 67%).

E-commerce 
In e-commerce, we showcase our brand differentiators such as exclusive product or engaging member 
experiences. Through scaling and expanding our e-commerce platform, we create business impact and 
efficiencies. Our 2020 ambition for sales through our own e-commerce platforms was increased from up 
to € 4 billion to more than € 4 billion, as we accelerated our digital transformation while retail stores were 
closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. We achieved our target through balancing short-, mid- and long-
term opportunities. We took radical actions to focus on digital acceleration by moving available inventory 
to e-commerce, invested into an agile digital content studio, shifted our marketing and tech budget toward 
digital and made sure our day-to-day decisions are data-driven with clear focus on consumer insights and 
trends. 
We continued the work toward premium, connected and personalized experiences that enable direct 
relationships with our consumers. In addition to our adidas e-commerce platform, which is available in 
over 50 countries, our adidas app strategy continued to fuel our mobile and member focus and has 
reached over 40 countries across all major markets, achieving a significant share of business in the adidas 
digital ecosystem. The adidas app is where we amplify our key brand territories such as sustainability and 
innovation. It is our gateway between online and offline and it provides a premium experience with 
immersive storytelling, personalized content, frictionless checkout, seamless order tracking, and access 
to our ‘Creators Club’ membership program. Members collect points from interactions across all our 
touchpoints (.com, apps, retail stores), climbing up different levels and unlocking rewards including 
personalized experiences, such as participation into a trivia around sustainability during our first-ever 
‘Creators Club’ Week to win a pair of Futurecraft.Loop, our first 100% recyclable performance running 
shoe. As 2020 saw the highest-ever sports engagement with our adidas Running and Training apps, these 
apps contribute to amplifying our purpose ‘through sport we have the power to change lives’. adidas is the 
only sports brand that rewards both physical and purchasing activity through membership points. The 
success of our Creators Club program is visible in key metrics such as increased consumer satisfaction as 
well as more than twice as high consumer lifetime value compared to non-members. 
In addition to the growth of existing touchpoints, we launched the Confirmed app in August as our new, 
most premium channel for sneakerheads and style in the US. We expanded the app to China in October. 
This app brings the best from the brand to our consumers, our most coveted and premium product in the 
easiest, fairest and most elevated way. 
Retail 
Our more than 2,500 own-retail stores are a vital part of the consumer journey. They are the best place for 
our consumers to directly interact with our brand, product and teams, and to touch and try our products, 
feel inspired by our stories and experience what we stand for as a brand. Through premium experiences 
and the human connection with our teams and communities we aim to build brand loyalty and increase 
consumer lifetime value. With our fleet of brand flagship stores focusing on premium experiences, 
concept stores with a more commercial focus and factory outlet stores for the value-seeking consumer, 
we provide an environment to satisfy all of our consumers’ needs when shopping our product and 
connecting with the essence of our brand.

In 2020, we focused on ensuring a profitable business through optimizing the store fleet, accelerating 
digital tools and creating a premium consumer experience. We increased the number of flagship stores 
and brand centers with a clear focus on digitalization, personalization, and a seamless consumer 
experience across all touchpoints. At the other end of the scale, we solidified our foundation to shift our 
factory outlet business from a clearance-focused channel to a commercial engine driving the profitability 
of the fleet that also showcases our product and brand storytelling. 
We made important investments to sharpen the top of the pyramid of our store fleet and strengthen our 
retail presence in key cities across our markets. In Europe, for example, we extended our flagship fleet by 
reopening the first-ever adidas Originals flagship store in Berlin and opening a new adidas Originals 
flagship store on Carnaby Street in London. Our renewed flagship store in Berlin is equipped with a design 
concept that promotes the store as the go-to destination for sought-after fashion collections and 
hyperlocal product launches. With the adidas Originals flagship store on Carnaby Street in London, we 
opened the first-ever gender-neutral store, which will house exclusive product, act as a community space 
and continue to showcase our strong focus on creating a more sustainable future.
 
Wholesale 
In 2020, the majority of consumers shopped sporting goods in a multi-brand wholesale environment. 
Wholesale is an important channel for our brand to reach consumers, authenticate and grow key 
categories for our business. Our main objective in wholesale is to win market share in critical consumer 
touchpoints on- and offline, especially in key trade zones and high streets. To do so, we identified our most 
important multi-brand and franchise customers and involved them in range and product development. 
Through leveraging our strong cross-functional partnerships with key wholesale partners in sales and 
activation, we see considerable success in landing our products, services, and stories. This is critical to 
ensure a holistic consumer journey. 
We continued our focus on and investments into digital capabilities to team up with our accounts to win 
online together. Our Partner Program platform brings us one step closer to where the consumer shops by 
providing strategic partners with unprecedented access to our products by connecting our systems to their 
digital platforms so they can gain access to our inventory. 2020 saw Partner Program roll out to new 
partners and locations, enabling us to fill gaps in their size availability and offer an extended range of 
products to their consumer. Furthermore, our investments into digital capabilities have allowed us to 
deliver an enhanced and consistent shopping experience in digital wholesale by making our product 
images and descriptions flow seamlessly into their systems to power their website and app experiences.

We value long-term relationships: 61% of our independent manufacturing partners have worked with 
adidas for at least ten years, and 30% have a tenure of more than 20 years. 
 
 
14 The 2019 Annual Report quoted 336 manufacturing partners, of which 32 were Tier 1 subcontractors. These subcontractors will not be included in the 
calculation in the future, and have therefore been removed for reasons of better comparison to the current year.

All our manufacturing partners are subject to specific performance criteria which are regularly measured 
and reviewed by Global Operations. To ensure the high quality that consumers expect from our products, 
we enforce strict control and inspection procedures of our manufacturing partners and in our own 
factories. Effectiveness of product-related standards is constantly measured through quality and material 
claim procedures. In addition, we track social and environmental performance criteria of our suppliers 
through the compliance and environmental KPI (C-KPI and E-KPI) tracking system. Adherence to social 
and environmental standards is promoted throughout our supply chain. The current list of our 
independent manufacturing partners can be found on our website.

Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our manufacturing partners  
⌐ Due to the global outbreak of the coronavirus, our independent manufacturing partners had to deal with 
facility closures, reduced working hours, and changes in operating procedures to implement social 
distancing and necessary safety measures. We reduced our production volumes to meet the lower global 
demand. At the same time, to keep the production volume relatively stable, we managed factory fill rates 
by pulling forward demand and production of ’evergreen’ products, such as Adilette slides, that are usually 
not subject to seasonal or trend-related change. We kept in touch with our manufacturing partners 
throughout the crisis and did not terminate any relationship due to the pandemic in 2020.

On-time in-full delivery to our customers  
Global Operations strives to develop, produce, source, and distribute ordered articles on time and in full. 
Therefore, a non-financial KPI ‘On-Time In-Full’ (OTIF) measures on-time and in-full delivery of our 
products toward the desired customer date for our wholesale and franchise customers as well as own-
retail stores. 
At the outset of the coronavirus crisis, beginning of 2020, the factory shutdowns in Asia impacted our 
ability to provide the highest product availability in our distribution centers. For the most part, as of March, 
the closure of our wholesale customer stores affected our capability to deliver products on time, despite 
sufficient product availability in our distribution centers. As our wholesale customers could not receive our 
products, our outflows were reduced, thereby creating congestion in our distribution centers. This 
negatively impacted our on-time and in-full deliveries from April onward, before recovery began in August, 
after stores and businesses had reopened for a longer period. At that time our global demand began to 
increase, and the flow of goods normalized again. In 2020, adidas delivered 76% of its adidas and Reebok 
brand products on time and in full (2019: 79%), missing its OTIF ambition of 82%. 
Agile and efficient distribution center network 
By following a clear strategic framework, we enhanced our distribution center landscape in 2020 through 
process automation, system upgrades, and distribution center capacity expansion. These enhancements 
helped enable us to improve e-commerce service levels and provide more delivery choices with an overall 
broader product availability. 
Overall, our global distribution network consists of 64 distribution centers, enabling us to efficiently and 
effectively service our global demand. We operate distribution centers in all our markets with twelve 
distribution centers in Europe, 22 in Asia-Pacific including one newly opened this year, ten in North 
America, eight in Latin America, two in Russia/CIS, and ten in Emerging Markets. 
Through own and partnership best-in-class execution, Global Operations ensures that the health and 
safety of both employees and consumers are maintained equally. Of the 64 distribution centers that make 
our global network, 29 are owned and operated by adidas, and 35 are owned and operated by logistics 
partners, allowing for the operational flexibility and agility to best service our customers and consumers.
 
To enable a broader range of products to be available at the point of sale, 17 of our distribution centers are 
set up to serve all our channels, 38 are specialized to serve our retail and wholesale customers, and nine 
are solely dedicated to servicing our e-commerce consumers. This diverse combination of distribution 
centers allows us to be agile and efficient in distributing our products to our customers and consumers 
across the globe.

adidas vs. partner-owned and -operated distribution centers per region 
 
 
Impact of the cornavirus pandemic on our supply chain 
Global Operations responded with speed and agility to address the challenges emanating from the 
outbreak of the coronavirus. Our supply chain organization took several measures to synchronize demand 
and supply in a cost-conscious manner: We reduced our production volumes to avoid excess supply, while 
ensuring our suppliers’ production capacities were maintained for upcoming seasons. Additionally, we 
mitigated the impact of further inventory build-up through effectively managing our existing inventory 
levels across our supply chain. We delayed the flow of in-transit goods and secured temporary overflow 
storage in our markets for goods that were not immediately needed by our customers. These actions 
mitigated congestion at our distribution centers allowing us to make in-demand products available at our 
distribution centers for on-time delivery to our customers and consumers around the globe. 
Positive impact on e-commerce volume growth  
While the coronavirus pandemic negatively impacted our demand in our retail and wholesale channels, it 
had a significant positive impact on our e-commerce channel. For example, in Europe, our distribution 
centers processed daily volumes equivalent to peak e-commerce events such as Cyber Week. To secure 
this spike in our e-commerce demand and minimize shipping delays to our consumers, we immediately 
increased our e-commerce distribution center capacities. At the same time, we maintained operations by 
implementing protocols for security and safety measures during the coronavirus crisis. To further support 
our future e-commerce growth, we are continuing to invest into our warehouse footprint and improve our 
omni-channel fulfillment capabilities.

our efforts on the following fundamentals: the attraction and retention of the right talents, role model 
leadership, diversity and inclusion, as well as the creation of a unique corporate culture.

STRATEGY ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/EMPLOYEES 
Measuring the success of our people initiatives 
⌐ Until 2020, our HR function measured the success and the effectiveness of the company’s efforts with 
regard to its people initiatives through two people KPIs: employee experience as an internal measure and 
employer rankings as an external measure. With the launch of the new strategic five-year cycle in 2021, 
we will revise this approach. 
¬ 
Employee engagement 
⌐ We are convinced that our employees’ feedback will play a crucial role in our pursuit of creating a 
desirable employee experience and continuing to attract and retain top talent. We can only tell if we are 
successful by asking our people, hence we empower them to share their feedback on a regular basis. In 
support of this thinking, we launched ‘People Pulse’ – our approach and system platform for measuring 
the level of employee satisfaction with the experience adidas provides as an employer – for all office 
employees with an email account. 
People Pulse allows for the measurement of the employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). The calculation 
logic of the eNPS is identical to that of the brand NPS: Based on the main question ‘On a scale of 0 to 10, 
how likely are you to recommend adidas as a place to work?’, the total share of detractors (responses 
below 7) is deducted from the total share of promoters (responses scoring 9 and 10), producing the eNPS. 
This approach as well as a focus on collecting open-comment feedback from employees on a regular basis 
allowed the reduction of the questionnaire to a short pulse check of seven questions maximum, with the 
aforementioned eNPS question at the center. 
In 2020, we saw the People Pulse continue to be leveraged as an important feedback channel from 
corporate employees to the company. We conducted a survey in September and saw an increase in 
employee NPS results – especially of favorable ratings – compared to the last survey conducted in 2019. At 
63%, the participation rate remained at a stable level. Reports with detailed results and scores were 
provided to the Executive Board and leaders down to Board –4 level as long as they have at least 
15 members on their team. Employees have access to the overall company results via our global intranet. 
Result recipients continued to review, cascade and openly discuss the results and drive action on identified 
areas of improvement. 
¬ 
Attraction and retention of talent 
⌐ Our ‘employer of choice’ status continues to garner worldwide recognition and helps us to attract, 
retain and engage industry-leading talent to sustain the company’s success and growth. In 2020, adidas 
locations around the world leveraged our employer value proposition for attraction, retention and 
engagement strategies. Among professionals, this work contributed to top rankings, including Forbes’ 
‘The World’s Best Employers 2020’ and Universum’s ‘World’s Most Attractive Employers’ rankings among 
business and IT students worldwide. adidas offices across Europe and Asia qualified for the certification by 
Top Employers Institute for their efforts to provide an exceptional work environment for our people.

Among other things, the certification recognized the company’s Learning and Development Framework, 
which encourages different kinds of learning and the career management model. 
We offer a range of entry-level programs to ensure future employees can have the best possible start, 
choose between a wide variety of learning opportunities, build on their strengths and improve their 
professional skills. 
─ Apprenticeship and Dual Study Program: The adidas ‘Apprenticeship Program’ offers pupils who want 
to join our company directly out of school, the opportunity to gain business experience in a two- to 
three-year rotation program. In cooperation with various universities, the ‘Dual Study Program’ for 
young school graduates offers theoretical and practical experience at adidas, including at least one 
three- to six-month international rotation. In 2020, we offered programs in several business areas, 
such as digital e-commerce, digital media, finance, IT, retail, logistics, shoe finishing, textile laboratory 
or textile and fashion tailoring. At the end of 2020, we employed 49 apprentices in Germany (2019: 50) 
and 38 Dual Study Program students (2019: 49). As part of our ‘Integration Program’, we also hired 
diverse future talents in 2020, for instance students with disabilities. 
─ Global Trainee Program: The ‘Functional, Digital and Design Trainee Program’ is an 18- to 24-month 
program providing graduates with an international background and excellent educational credentials 
the opportunity to start a functional career within adidas. At year-end 2020, we employed 
38 participants in our Global Trainee Program (2019: 67). 
─ Internships: Our internship program offers students three to six months of work experience within 
adidas. In 2020, we employed 114 interns in Germany (2019: 216). 
¬ 
Role model leadership 
⌐ Our learning and development offerings focus on developing the leadership behaviors and essential 
skills needed to ensure our continued success. Our ambition is to inspire and nurture talented and diverse 
leaders who exemplify our leadership behaviors. 
¬ 
Leadership groups 
⌐ We have four standing groups to ensure leadership excellence and develop future leaders. The first two 
groups, the Core Leadership Group (CLG) and the Extended Leadership Group (ELG) focus on excellence in 
execution of our strategy and ensuring global consistency. The other two groups focus on developing 
global, regional and functional succession pipelines. 
─ The Core Leadership Group (CLG) is made up of approximately 20 members of our senior leadership 
population. Members of this group jointly represent critical positions and roles across our company 
worldwide. This group partners with the Executive Board in leading the execution of our business 
strategy. The CLG is also responsible for developing and inspiring the next generation of leaders. In 
addition, selected members of this group are potential successors for the Executive Board. 
─ The Extended Leadership Group (ELG) has approximately 110 members. The ELG collaborates across 
markets and functions to lead the execution of our strategic initiatives and to drive continuous 
improvement and consistency throughout the organization. The ELG also mentors and sponsors the 
Global and Local High Potential Groups. In addition, selected members are potential successors for the 
CLG. 
─ The Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) enables us to identify and develop global high-potential 
leaders who have the ability to take on more complex, demanding and higher-level responsibilities at 
an executive level. In 2019, the second GHIPO generation started their development experience, with

approximately 40 members and a balanced gender split. They will conclude their development 
experience in the first quarter of 2021. At the end of 2020, nearly three-quarters made positive career 
movements through either a promotion to the next level or a lateral, cross-cultural or cross-functional 
moves.  
─ The Local High Potential Group (LHIPO) was formed in 2019 and enables us to identify and develop 
local high-potential leaders who have the ability to take on more complex, demanding and higher-level 
responsibilities at a global or regional leadership level. The program is designed to build peer 
relationships and to give participants cross-functional and cross-cultural exposure. The first LHIPO 
generation, consisting of approximately 120 leaders of 30 different nationalities, concluded their 
development experience in the first quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the second LHIPO 
generation started their 12-month development experience with approximately 180 members of 41 
different nationalities representing all markets and functions. 55% of the members of this group are 
female. 
¬ 
Leadership development experiences 
⌐ To drive clarity and accountability, we worked on further activating our global Leadership Framework in 
2020 by embedding it in our leadership groups and development experiences. The Leadership Framework 
is based on three critical behaviors – Creativity, Collaboration and Confidence (the ‘3Cs’). The 3Cs define 
the behaviors that are expected of employees at adidas. The framework provides a global and universal 
language that is inclusive, reduces the need for local interpretations, and outlines concrete behaviors that 
serve as a measure of leadership effectiveness. Creativity, Collaboration and Confidence serve as the 
foundation for the way we hire, promote and evaluate performance. 
We offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of management 
across all markets and functions. These include the Manager Development Experience (MDE), Director 
Development Experience (DDE) and Executive Development Experience (EDE). These interactive learning 
experiences support the development of leadership skills that are directly linked to the participants’ 
current roles and responsibilities. In 2020, 1,277 employees activated their MDE or DDE experience, with 
933 graduates and of those 768 employees graduating the programs through the virtual experience.
¬ 
Succession management 
⌐ Our succession management approach aims to ensure stability and certainty in business continuity 
through the development of strong internal pipelines of talent for critical leadership positions. We achieve 
this through a globally consistent succession process that identifies these critical leadership positions 
within the organization and matches top talent as successors for these roles. Furthermore, we drive the 
translation of succession planning into realizable development plans to prepare successors for their next 
steps. The leadership groups we have established serve as succession pools for the executive roles of our 
organization. 
¬ 
Activating our purpose 
⌐ ‘Through sport, we have the power to change lives’ is our company’s purpose. Together with our 
employees, partners, communities, and consumers, we act on that purpose by fostering a culture of 
inclusion, impact, and shared opportunity on and off the field of play. We focus our activation efforts on 
four areas: ‘She Breaks Barriers’, which is aimed at getting girls to join and stay in sport, ‘One Starting 
Line’, which is aimed at increasing inclusivity for all in sport and sports culture, ‘End Plastic Waste, which 
is aimed at protecting the world’s oceans for future generations, and ‘Diversity and Inclusion’. To 
maximize impact, we leverage brand moments to raise awareness of these topics and create opportunities 
to engage and get involved, such as by providing volunteering opportunities for our employees. All of our 
initiatives and activities in this area are centrally managed by a dedicated ‘Global Purpose’ team, reporting

into the Executive Board Member responsible for Global Human Resources. Since 2020 was a year of 
unprecedented adversity around the world, many of our actions were in response to these events. 
In the wake of the global covid-19 pandemic, we took several actions to help communities worldwide 
weather the crisis – from fundraising and donations to mask production and employee engagement. In 
addition, there were numerous activities and measures taken at the local level around the world.  
─ Fundraising and donations: We donated to the World Health Organization’s ‘Covid-19 Solidarity 
Response Fund’ and to the ‘China Youth Development Foundation’, and, together with our consumers 
and employees, raised and donated funds through e-commerce giveback programs and the 
#hometeamhero challenge – a digital challenge that encouraged physical activity through the ‘adidas 
Running’ and ‘adidas Training’ apps as well as partner apps, with a donation made by the company per 
every hour of activity. 
─ Mask production and donation: In April 2020, we partnered with Carbon, a 3D-printing technology 
company, and produced face shields that were donated to hospitals, healthcare organizations, and 
various medically focused non-profit organizations. In total, 75,000 face shields were made and 
donated.  
─ Employee volunteering: Using the community impact platform DEED, which we have rolled out to 
employees in several markets around the world in 2020, we created a country-specific covid-19 
fundraiser for the US and Canada, Germany, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Panama, 
Turkey, Israel, India, and South Africa. In addition, we coordinated volunteering opportunities for our 
employees across North America, Latin America, and Germany. 
In addition to our efforts to help cope with the covid-19 crisis, we supported other disaster-relief actions in 
2020. For example, together with contributions from our employees, we donated funds to support wildfire 
relief in Australia and North America, as well as to help the people of Beirut following the port explosion in 
August 2020. 
¬ 
Diversity and inclusion 
⌐ We strongly believe that diversity, inclusion, and equality are key to the success of our company. To be 
the best sports brand in the world, we need the best diverse talent that reflects the diversity of our 
customers and consumers. We celebrate this diversity as it helps us better serve the communities we 
work in, while also providing a competitive business advantage. 
United against racism – our commitments 
We have always been and will always be against discrimination in all forms and stand united against 
racism. To emphasize this principle, we shared a list of global commitments in June 2020. They describe 
how we aim to contribute to creating lasting change. The commitments include, among others, investing 
$ 120 million in the US toward ending racism and supporting Black communities through to 2025, and 
funding 50 university scholarships in the US each year for Black and LatinX students. We also set new 
targets for increased representation of Black and LatinX people within our US workforce. Our aim is to fill 
at least 30% of all new positions in the US with Black and LatinX people. The commitments further 
encompass establishing a global committee to accelerate inclusion and equality, strengthening our global 
anti-discrimination and non-retaliation policy, reforming our hiring and career development processes, 
signing the Juneteenth Pledge, and increasing support for BIPoC communities.

We already took action on several of these commitments in the latter half of 2020: 
─ We funded scholarship programs for Black and LatinX students and made an initial contribution 
to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as part of singer and 
adidas partner Beyoncé’s ‘BeyGOOD’ fund to support Black-owned small businesses. 
─ The ‘Committee to Accelerate Inclusion & Equality’ has been put in operation. Sponsored by 
adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted, it focuses on the advancement of underrepresented groups and 
drives companywide change. The committee includes company decision makers as well as 
representatives from all adidas regions and people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
─ Our talent acquisition and key talent management processes are currently under review to 
validate opportunities to further strengthen our inclusive talent processes for hiring, talent 
management and succession decisions. 
─ We updated our ‘Global Policy on Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination’ in September. The 
framework details how adidas prevents, detects, and responds to all forms of discrimination and 
harassment with very clear messaging on our zero-tolerance approach.  
► ADIDAS.COM/US/LASTING_CHANGE 
Furthermore, we provided our employees with a platform on our intranet to support and promote dialogue 
around our anti-racism and anti-discrimination work. Throughout the company, we continue to support 
and grow our ‘Employee Resource Groups’ – these are specific networks that give employees from various 
walks of life a voice and serves members by fostering a diverse inclusive workplace. We now have more 
than 40 of these groups around the globe with different focuses on diversity dimensions such as People of 
Color, Women, LGBTQ+, Experienced Generation, Faith, and Disability and Mental Health. Participation in 
the groups is voluntary and open to all employees. 
¬ 
Diversity & Inclusion framework 
⌐ In 2020, we redefined our framework for diversity and inclusion with a clear definition of what diversity 
and inclusion mean to us as a company: They mean championing individual uniqueness, and cultivating a 
culture of belonging so that everyone can create at their best. The framework highlights our approach both 
internally and externally which is why we defined three strategic focus areas:  
─ Workplace: We want to create a work environment where all employees feel like they belong, are 
valued and are engaged to produce exceptional results. 
─ Workforce: We want to attract, recruit, promote, and retain the best talent and maintain a diverse 
workforce at all levels and areas of the business. 
─ Marketplace: We want to represent the diverse communities we serve through our communications, 
products, partnerships, and investments.  
As part of the three focus areas, we have made global internal commitments to promote inclusion and 
equality at adidas. These commitments are supported by specific actions with clear timelines, and 
progress is communicated internally. This action plan underpins our stance against discrimination and 
microaggressions. 
One of the commitments we made was the introduction of a global anti-racism and unconscious-bias 
training – the ‘Creating a Culture of Inclusion (CCI) Team Workout’. The training, which was mandatory for 
all employees, was rolled out globally in the third quarter of 2020 and completed in early 2021. The

program consisted of six modules which focused on topics such as diversity dimensions, privilege, and 
inclusive team behaviors. The content was aimed at educating teams on diversity and inclusion topics that 
may impact performance and the sense of belonging, both individually and as a team.  
In addition, we held a virtual ‘Global Day of Inclusion’ in September 2020, which offered employees an 
opportunity to reflect, learn, and celebrate inclusion. The day was about taking the time to embrace the 
various backgrounds, experiences and perspectives of all our communities by exploring different stories 
through a business panel, an athlete panel, and more. 
¬ 
Female leadership 
⌐ We are convinced that mixed leadership teams have a competitive advantage and are drivers of 
business success. adidas is committed to ensuring equitable representation across all diversity 
dimensions in leadership positions, which includes enhancing our current focus on gender equality. A 
prerequisite for increasing the number of women at the highest levels of management is the general 
promotion of women within the company worldwide at all levels. We have various initiatives in place to 
guarantee that our succession pipeline is balanced, including mentoring of female talent as well as an 
equal gender split in our Global and Local High Potential programs. 
By the end of 2020, the company had recorded a total of 35% of women globally in management positions 
(2019: 34%), exceeding the 2020 target of 32%. Our ambition is to further increase the share of women in 
leadership positions globally from 2021 onward. Pursuant to the German Law on Equal Participation of 
Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public Sector, the adidas AG Supervisory Board 
determined target figures for the percentage of female representation on the Executive Board, including 
corresponding deadlines for their achievement.The Executive Board determined such target figures for the 
first two management levels below the Executive Board, including deadlines for their achievement, for 
adidas AG.

CULTURE 
⌐ It is our goal to develop a culture that cherishes creativity, collaboration and confidence as well as high 
performance, the behaviors we deem to be crucial to the successful delivery of our strategy. In fact, our 
culture and people are a key to our new strategy ‘Own the Game’. 
¬ 
Work-life integration 
⌐ We aim to harmonize the commercial interests of the company with the professional, private and family 
needs of our employees. Our Work-Life Integration initiatives and programs include the provision of 
flexible working times and locations, personal development and leadership competence related to work-
life integration, as well as family-oriented services: 
─ Childcare: In addition to providing flexible working opportunities such as work from home and 
sabbaticals, we cater for a family-friendly environment and infrastructure. At our headquarters in 
Herzogenaurach, we offer parent-child offices, and provide for a childcare facility, the ‘World of Kids’. It 
offers space for 270 children and includes an outdoor group and ad-hoc childcare to support parents in 
emergency situations or during transition phases and short-term assignments. During school holidays,

kids’ camps are usually very popular and offered at various locations across the globe. Due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, however, we were forced to cancel these and other offers in 2020. Instead, new 
solutions were implemented to assist parents working from home in challenging times while catering 
for childcare and home-schooling. These included coronavirus hotlines for parents and caregivers, 
interactive online sessions, and presentations from experts as well as tutoring for pupils and digital 
offerings for kids with focus on movement, nature, and craft. 
─ Parental leave: For parental leave and re-entry, programs are in place to provide employees with 
advice early on and options for their return to work, also taking into consideration flexible working 
hours and work locations. In Germany, we guarantee our employees on parental leave their positions, 
which are only filled temporarily. In the US, in addition to regular parental leave for new parents (up to 
10 weeks at home, 70% of their salary), adidas offers an extra two weeks of paid parental leave for 
parents. Furthermore, adidas’ special parental bonding leave provides parents with the opportunity to 
stay home for up to six months within the first twelve months after the child’s birth or placement. 
While unpaid, it offers parents the opportunity to stay home longer and take care of their new arrival 
and new life together. Latin America has made significant amendments to improve work-life 
integration across the market. This includes an extended parental leave approach where mothers will 
be provided 24 paid weeks in total to spend with their children, and fathers/partners will be provided 
20 paid days in total. On top of this, mothers are allowed to work fewer hours one month before and 
after their maternity leave period. 
─ Flexible work: Continuing in Germany in 2020, every employee with an adidas AG contract whose 
working tasks can be carried out independently of campus facilities, campus equipment, and personal 
interaction on-site is eligible to work 20% of their total working time off-campus. This policy and 
agreement is based on our belief that results can be achieved in the same quality and quantity, 
regardless of people’s location. Positive feedback motivated us to roll out the approach globally and 
with Asia having joined in 2020, all markets are now fully on board. With this worldwide off-campus-
working approach in place, adidas was well prepared and equipped for the transition to home-office 
mode during the pandemic. 
¬ 
Health management 
⌐ We support our employees by aiming to provide the best possible conditions to ensure that they feel 
good and stay healthy. Our holistic approach includes people’s physical, mental, and social well-being, and 
focuses on four pillars: mindset, nutrition, movement and medical services. We provide employees access 
to various sports activities and facilities. Also, lockers and showers in many office buildings allow people 
to run or cycle to work. Employees in Herzogenaurach, Portland, Boston, Moscow, Gurgaon and 
Manchester, and at other locations across the globe, have access to a corporate gym. However, the 
coronavirus pandemic required us to close gyms, stop programs and focus on alternatives. Thus, digital 
offers were designed for employees to support a healthy lifestyle at home. This included an online sports 
program as well as broad virtual offerings on nutrition, mental health, and resilience. We offer Employee 
Assistance Programs in many countries (for instance in the US, Germany, and the UK). In 2020, Latin 
America introduced an equivalent program across the market.

Navigating through the coronavirus pandemic 
⌐ Since the beginning of the covid-19 crisis, the safety and well-being of our employees, consumers and 
partners has been our top priority. In our offices, stores and warehouses around the globe, we have 
installed a variety of measures to ensure the ongoing safety of our people and limit the risk of infections at 
the workplace or while traveling. These measures include the extension of our hygiene concepts, the 
continuous monitoring of the development of the situation, transparent communication to our employees, 
and the establishment of strict rules of conduct. For example, we have increased workplace flexibility and 
temporarily given our employees theo opportunity to work up to 100% of their time remotely, depending on 
the development of cases in the respective countries. 
─ Crisis management team: To be able to monitor and assess the impacts and potential spread of the 
coronavirus globally, we set up a dedicated Steering Committee in February. The task of this HR-led, 
cross-functional team is to provide guidance to our markets on emerging issues, standards and 
company policies to ensure alignment in the response to covid-19. The team also tracks internal covid-
19 cases globally, and reports these to the Executive Board. This measure enables us to determine any 
actions needed at all locations globally. The Steering Committee meets up to three times per week to 
review employee case numbers, impacts to the business, emerging issues, and review current policies, 
guidelines and direction to the business and our workforce. Updates are provided to the Executive 
Board on a regular basis, at least twice per month. 
─ HR training and alignment: To enable our HR Business Partners to report on cases, conduct contact 
tracing and manage any employee-related crisis issues, we introduced global trainings for our HR 
Business Partners. These trainings are repeated as often as necessary to ensure our partners are able 
to act upon the most recent developments at any time. To create alignment and awareness of new 
processes or emerging situations in the markets, we have also set up a weekly call for market HR 
leaders. In this meeting, any employee- and covid-19-related issues are discussed and decisions are 
made on necessary actions. 
─ Retail: In our own-retail stores, hygiene concepts encompass distancing rules and the installation of 
plexiglass screens. Our retail staff was trained on hygiene measures, contact tracing and case 
reporting to guarantee sufficient response actions to ensure the safety of all employees and 
customers. In addition, we created so-called ,Retail Response Teams’ to ensure the implementation of 
regulations and standards in our stores. 
¬ 
Learning 
⌐ We are convinced that employee development enables a high-performance culture. To achieve this, we 
offer employees a wide range of learning and development opportunities. These include online learning 
resources and interactive learning experiences that are designed to increase the personal and 
professional effectiveness of our employees. 
In 2020, we saw a sharp increase in the use of our digitally enabled learning tools with an increase in 
utilization of 162% of our LinkedIn Learning offerings and 158% for our Leadership Library offerings 
compared to last year. In response to the changes in the workplace, we transformed our in-person 
development trainings into interactive virtual learning experiences. As a result, we increased the number 
of virtual offerings by 258% which tripled the participation in virtual offerings compared to 2019.

Performance management 
⌐ #MYBEST is the global performance development approach at adidas and is a key enabler of a high-

employees is critical in the evolution of #MYBEST. In 2019, the global #MYBEST survey was run for the 
second year in a row. The results confirmed the positive impact of the previous year’s enhancements and 
were also used to inform decisions about interventions supporting the full utilization of the #MYBEST 
approach. In 2020, we ensured that the organization has clarity regarding meaningful performance 
conversations while navigating the constantly changing environment. We also launched a series of global 
virtual events to provide practical tips and company best practice examples to all employees on impactful 
feedback and development conversations. To reduce the risk of potential bias in performance evaluations, 
we provided tools and guidance for all line managers to use when preparing for their regular Performance

Rewards

are inclusive, competitive in the marketplace and aligned with our culture of ‘rewarding for performance’. 
Remuneration throughout the company comprises fixed and variable monetary compensation, non-
monetary rewards, and other intangible benefits. Important cornerstones of our rewards program are our 
Job Architecture and our Global Salary Management System which are used as a basis for establishing 
and evaluating the value of employees’ positions and salaries in a market-driven and performance-
oriented way. 
The various variable compensation and benefits components we offer our employees include:

We are continuously improving our remuneration approach and have therefore been investing in a number 
of projects and initiatives to increase the significance of our remuneration programs and to ensure we 
balance our investment in our employees with regard to performance, potential and market-oriented 
compensation. One of the improvements we made was an overhaul of our compensation management 
approach in Germany and the US throughout the last three years, which is designed to enable educated 
compensation decisions based on external market reference and internal equity. It is based on a higher 
level of detail for external market data and addresses internal pay gaps. We developed a monitoring 
approach to identify potential pay gaps and work continuously to improve and close these gaps on a 
country-by-country basis. To further enhance our efforts and transparency on this topic we support 
initiatives such as ‘Lean In’. The latest internal report from 2019 regarding the Equal Pay Gap shows an 
overall balanced picture on pay between female and male employees, based on a weighted average 
calculation between the salary grade levels. 
In addition, we further improved transparency and governance for senior management remuneration and 
created higher transparency about remuneration as well as internal and external positioning of 
compensation and benefits packages. The aim was to ensure objective decision-making for management 
remuneration, and to continue standardizing our pay structures. 
We rolled out a global Long-Term Incentive Plan for senior management over the past few years, which is 
in place for all employees down to director level globally. This program provides Restricted Stock Units 
(RSUs), linked to our earnings per share (EPS) targets and our share price performance. It closely links 
the goals of our senior management with those of our shareholders – sustainable success and long-term 
growth – and fosters a company ownership mentality. 
Our subsidiaries also grant a variety of benefits to employees, depending upon locally defined practices 
and country-specific regulations and norms.

Stock Purchase Plan 
⌐ Participation in the Stock Purchase Plan is provided to employees in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 
Netherlands, the US and Germany, offering almost half of our employees globally (excluding retail) the 
opportunity to participate. Around 5,400 employees participated in the program in 2020 (2019: 5,000).

SUSTAINABILITY 
Being a sustainable business is about striking a balance between shareholder expectations and the 
needs and concerns of our employees, consumers, and communities, as well as the workers in our 
supply chain and the environment. We believe that acting as a responsible company will contribute to 
lasting economic success. 
OUR APPROACH 
⌐ Our holistic approach to sustainability responds to the challenges that endanger our planet and people. 
Consequently, sustainability is an integral component of our strategy ‘Own the Game’ and we have a clear 
roadmap for 2025 and beyond. It tackles the topics that are most material to our business and our 
stakeholders, and translates our overall sustainability efforts into tangible goals. 
¬ ► ADIDAS-
GROUP.COM/SUSTAINABILITY 
►  SEE STRATEGY 
Material topics 
⌐ We seek to ensure that we address the topics that are most salient to our business and our 
stakeholders, and the challenges ahead. To identify these topics, we openly engage with our stakeholders 
and consider their views and opinions in decisions that shape our day-to-day-operations. In addition, we 
regularly conduct formal materiality exercises to confirm the selection of our material topics. We use 
insights gained from past assessments, categorize potential new topics and seek to validate these through 
in-depth discussions with experts and stakeholders across the entire business. Ultimately, we want to 
better understand the importance a topic has for our business performance and stakeholders but also 
gain more visibility about the impact we have on these topics. As a result of this ongoing exercise, tax has 
emerged as an addition to this list of topics in 2020.   
We also make use of external frameworks to help support our selection of material topics. One of these 
frameworks is the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which represents a global call to action to 
promote prosperity for all while protecting the planet. We see a clear correlation between the SDGs and 
our own commitment to sustainable development and human rights. Consequently, we have been able to 
link prioritized SDGs with both the environmental priorities related to the selection of materials, 
manufacturing, use and disposal of our products, and the needs and concerns of people in the adidas value 
chain.

Stakeholder dialogue and transparency 
⌐ Engaging openly with stakeholders and establishing ways to increase transparency and disclosure has 
long been central to our approach. Our stakeholders are those people or organizations who affect or are 
affected by our operations, including our employees, consumers, suppliers and their workers, customers, 
investors, media, governments, and NGOs. The adidas Stakeholder Relations Guideline specifies key 
principles for the development of stakeholder relations and details the different forms of stakeholder 
engagement.  
adidas participates in a variety of industry associations, multi-stakeholder organizations, and non-profit 
initiatives. Through these memberships, we work closely with leading companies from different sectors to 
develop sustainable business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a global and 
local level. We use collaborations and partnerships to build leverage for systemic change in our industry, 
such as for strengthening chemical management practices and raising standards in the cotton supply 
chain. In addition, we build awareness, capacity, and knowledge of laws and rights among factory 
management and workers by partnering with leading providers such as the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO) Better Factories Cambodia program, as well as with the United Nation’s International 
Organization for Migration with the objective to ensure that the labor rights of foreign and migrant workers 
are upheld in the adidas supply chain.

External recognition 
⌐ adidas continuously receives positive recognition from international institutions, rating agencies, NGOs 
and socially responsible investment analysts for its sustainability initiatives. In 2020, the company was 
again represented in high-profile sustainability indices and subject to comprehensive corporate 
sustainability assessments. 
► SEE OUR SHARE 
In the annual assessment of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), adidas was again awarded with a 
B score for its climate change approach (2019: B), and for its approach to water management (2019: B) 
and an A- score for its supplier engagement approach related to climate change (assessed through the 
Supplier Engagement Rating). In the annual Green Supply Chain Corporate Information Transparency 
Index (CITI), which assesses brands on the environmental management of their supply chains in China, 
adidas ranked number four in the textile industry with its green supply chain program in China, and 
achieved first place in the newly added Supply Chain Climate Action Index (SCTI), sharing the position with 
another company. adidas further maintained its leadership position in the Corporate Human Rights 
Benchmark (CHRB) evaluation in 2020, coming in first in our industry and fourth overall across all 
industries assessed. 
¬ ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/RECOGNITION 
OUR PROGRESS 
⌐ Following our ambition to be transparent toward stakeholders for years, adidas has regularly reported 
on our sustainability performance by measuring and disclosing the progress made toward our targets. The 
following presents the list of material topics within our programs and details the progress made and 
challenges faced. Although 2020 was a difficult year due to the coronavirus pandemic, making it necessary 
to adhere to local regulations such as store closures and travel bans, we were, overall, able to advance 
our initiatives and deliver against our targets. 
¬ 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
⌐ Managing the environmental impacts at our own sites and along the value chain is a key focus of our 
work. We have developed an approach to address water efficiency and quality and are committed to 
steadily increasing the use of more sustainable materials in our production, products and stores while 
driving toward circular business solutions. We are committed to reducing our absolute energy 
consumption and CO
2 emissions, transitioning to clean energy and looking into energy-harvesting 
opportunities.  
To be able to quantify our environmental impact along the value chain, we developed an internal 
Environmental Footprint Tool (EFT). This tool uses data from various IT systems and departmental sources to 
calculate a monetized environmental footprint that accounts for the complete value chain from raw material 
production to product use and disposal. Currently, the EFT is primarily used for measurement as well as 
internal and external reporting. As such, it provided key insights for the development process of our new 
strategy ‘Own the Game’. A future objective is to directly interface the adidas systems with the EFT to enable 
real-time simulations to support business decision-making and further sustainability reporting.

Own operations 
⌐ Back in 2008, adidas introduced a program called ‘Green Company’ to drive continuous improvement 
and savings in energy, water and waste at its own sites globally. The program covers administrative 
offices, production facilities and distribution centers, equaling more than 97% of our global employee base 
in 2020 (excluding own retail). In 2015, we presented targets to be achieved by 2020 that centered around 
carbon emissions and water use reduction. These were calculated considering a scientific and context-
based methodology. 
One essential driver to achieve these targets is the implementation of environmental standards at our 
highest-consuming locations. adidas has successfully applied an Integrated Management System (IMS) 
which helps us to gain certification for key locations for their environmental management (ISO 14001),

health and safety management (ISO 45001) and energy management (ISO 50001). Building on an 
overarching corporate IMS policy, adidas aims to further expand these certifications to more key sites 
every year and have them verified through both external and internal audits. By the end of 2020, 42 sites 
globally held an ISO 14001 certification, 39 sites held an ISO 45001 certification, and 53 sites held an ISO 
50001 certification. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the IMS implementation, as well as internal and 
external audits were mostly done remotely for the first time.  
In 2020, we were able to cumulatively reduce our combined net emissions by 55% compared to 2015. This 
is a result of our energy saving initiatives, the use of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) at central sites, a 
company-wide energy monitoring systems, and the installation of photovoltaic systems at various 
locations. On top we offset the carbon footprint of our gas consumption for all our facilities in Germany. To 
calculate the overall footprint of all other sites, globally, we take the location-based emission factor 
provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In 2020, the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic also had 
a positive impact on the energy and water consumption at our sites. As a result, in 2020 our accumulated 
water savings amounted to 48% per employee compared to 2008. With these results, we have 
overachieved our targets of the last strategic cycle.  
By 2025, we aim to achhieve carbon neutrality for our corporate and own-retail sites through 
implementing on-site energy production, improving energy use efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and 
balancing our emissions through various partnership methods. We will also continue to monitor and 
improve the water efficiencies at our biggest consuming sites. We will further strengthen our 
sustainability foundation by increasing the environmental performance data coverage. Furthermore, we 
will continue to push implementing eco-efficiency standards through the IMS at key sites.  
The progress toward all Green Company targets is tracked through an environmental data reporting 
system and is disclosed in detail in our annual Green Company Report, available on our corporate website 
as of spring 2021.

Supply chain 
⌐ As our production is fully outsourced, a substantial portion of our environmental impact occurs, at 
different intensities, throughout the supply chain. Therefore, for adidas, sourcing is not only about 
ensuring high product quality and timely delivery, it also means working with our suppliers to ensure they 
are continuously reducing their environmental footprint by measuring their monthly progress toward 
yearly reduction targets for energy, water and waste. One way we provide support is to develop 
comprehensive policies and guidelines such as the newly added ‘Rooftop Solar Guideline’ and ‘Waste Co-
processing Due Diligence’.  
Already in 2019, we started to support our suppliers in scaling the adoption of on-site renewable energy in 
our supply chain. adidas funded and provided technical expertise for solar rooftop feasibility studies in key 
sourcing countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Myanmar, covering approximately 
80% of our strategic suppliers. Even though 2020 was a challenging year due to the pandemic, we were 
able to intensify our efforts and have already seen the first positive results. In 2020, we confirmed that 
additional 27 MWp rooftop solar systems had been installed by our strategic suppliers.  
We want to ensure that our suppliers are a part of our low-carbon journey and have therefore actively 
supported our global suppliers by engaging experts, providing hands-on training and developing multiple 
tools and guidelines over the past years. The ‘adidas Environmental Good Practice Guide & Toolkit’ covers 
over 60 efficiency measures and provides good practices for identifying environmental impacts and carbon 
reduction opportunities within the factory’s operations.  
Furthermore, adidas is working closely with key suppliers in Vietnam, providing the technical guidance and 
expertise to enrol and access the first off-site renewable energy pilot. The pilot program features direct 
power purchase agreement (DPPA) mechanisms between renewable energy developers/power generation 
companies and private power buyers/consumers. DPPA mechanisms are surging around the world as a 
new driver and catalyst for renewable energy projects. 
We are co-developing an online climate action training program with Deutsche Gesellschaft für 
Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) which will be made available to all of the UNFCCC signatory brands 
and their supply chain. The aim is to upskill the fashion supply chain on greenhouse gas emissions, and 
how to set targets and identify reduction measures such as adopting renewable energy and improving 
energy efficiency. 
Through our collective measures and technical support, our suppliers were able to exceed our five-year 
environmental targets on energy, water and waste.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
As we accelerate our sustainability efforts, we continue to support our supplier partners to improve their 
performance and ensure that this is underpinned by sound environmental management systems and 
accurate data disclosure. In 2020, for example, 98% of our footwear sourcing volume was produced in 
factories that have been certified in accordance with the International Environmental Standards ISO 14001 
and/or the Workplace Health and Safety Management Standards OHSAS 18001 (2019: 98%).  
In 2021, we will transition to a set of environmental targets that are in line with our public commitment of 
reducing absolute CO
2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and our broader sustainability strategy. For the supply 
chain, we will focus on transitioning from energy efficiency to end-to-end carbon management, expanding 
on Tier 2 water savings, and driving further adoption of ZDHC-qualified chemicals and the delivery of 
cleaner effluent.  
Supply chain targets for 2025 
─ Water: We have met and exceeded our previous five-year target on water savings for strategic Tier 1 
and Tier 2 suppliers. We are expanding our water reduction efforts to include additional Tier 2 
suppliers. Through the application of new technologies, our aim is to achieve a 40% reduction in water 
consumption against the 2017 baseline year by 2025. 
─ Chemicals: Building on our long-standing collaboration with ZDHC, which promotes sustainable 
chemistry, we aim to have 80% of supplier facilities that manage chemicals in their production process 
to achieve Level 3 compliance with the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MSRL) from ZDHC 
for their input chemicals by 2025.
 
─ Wastewater: Pollution abatement is critically important for the textile industry and a basic compliance 
expectation. We aim for 80% of applicable suppliers that operate on-site effluents plants to achieve a 
‘ZDHC Wastewater Foundational Level’ (direct discharge) by 2025. 
─ Energy: As part of our 2021 carbon priorities and goals, adidas aims to accelerate initiatives that drive 
low-carbon manufacturing within its supply chain. That is why, in 2021, we will focus on scaling the 
adoption of renewable energy at existing Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities. Through the adoption and 
scalability of renewable energy and coal replacement, our aim is to keep our emissions flat against the 
2017 baseline year by 2025.

Chemical management 
⌐ Contributing to a better environment and a safer living space, adidas has been building and 
implementing a leading chemical management program in its supply chain for years. We have defined an 
end-to-end-approach spanning the management of chemical input, monitoring the chemical management 
in our supply chain, and reporting supplier performance data publicly to controlling the finished end 
product. 
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CHEMICAL-FOOTPRINT 
Driving effective and sustainable solutions, it requires a strong collaboration with different stakeholders, 
including industry federations and chemical experts. Together with all industry partners, we continued to 
contribute to the development and updating of both the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List 
(MRSL) and the ZDHC Chemical Management Guidance Framework (CMS). The publication of ZDHC CMS 
provides a critical link between controlling chemical input and monitoring output. It supports our supply 
chain chemical management program and helps to avoid hazardous chemicals entering the production 
processes. 
We further improved our chemical input management, recording 83% of auxiliaries volume and 91% of 
dyestuffs volume from our strategic apparel suppliers as bluesign-approved in 2020. We also continued to 
be 99% free of poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFCs) in our products for the fall/winter 2021 season.

Sustainable materials and processes 
⌐ We are committed to steadily increasing the use of more sustainable materials in our production, 
products and stores. We push toward sustainable innovation and circular business solutions. 
Synthetic fibers are widely used in our industry due to their unique performance properties such as 
elasticity, light weight, and high durability. We are aware that products made out of synthetic fibers can 
have a negative environmental impact during their use phase and acknowledge microfiber pollution as a 
complex challenge for our industry – one we are proactively addressing. We have established a cross-
functional working group and closely collaborate with our suppliers and research institutes to raise 
awareness of the issue and drive joint solutions toward a global testing standard. adidas is co-founder of 
The Microfibre Consortium (TMC), which is operational as of 2019, and among others develops tools to 
minimize shedding and the release of microfibers into the environment, for example via a testing method 
that enables us to obtain results about the shedding potential of our materials.

Sustainable cotton 
adidas has steadily increased the sourcing of cotton according to the Better Cotton Initiative throughout 
the last several years and already managed to source 100% sustainable cotton by the end of 2018. In 2020, 
we continued to source all cotton globally as more sustainable cotton. The Better Cotton Initiative aims to 
reduce the use of pesticides, promotes efficient water use, crop rotation and fair working conditions, and 
strives to transform cotton production worldwide by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream 
commodity.

Recycled polyester 
Using more recycled polyester is yet another way we seek to improve our environmental footprint while 
still making high-performance products for the athlete. Polyester is the most common single-used 
material in adidas products and, by 2024, we aim to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in 
all products where a solution exists. We set clear internal milestones for product creation teams and have 
seen great progress throughout the last several seasons. In 2020, 71% of all polyester used for our 
apparel and footwear ranges was already recycled polyester. With that, we are ahead of our plan to use 
only recycled polyester from 2024 onward. The ‘Primeblue’ and ‘Primegreen’ labels, which were 
introduced in 2020, mark products made with recycled materials. While offering full functionality and 
durability in sports, they avoid waste and preserve natural resources.

Parley Ocean Plastic 
Since 2015, adidas has partnered up with the environmental organization ,Parley for the Oceans’ and uses 
Parley Ocean Plastic as an eco-innovative replacement for virgin plastic. We continued to roll out Parley 
Ocean Plastic across key categories and introduced our own label in 2020 for products that contain a 
certain amount of Parley Ocean Plastic: Primeblue. In 2020, we produced more than 15 million pairs of 
shoes containing Parley Ocean Plastic. Our target for 2021 is to produce 17 million pairs of such shoes.

Waste and packaging 
We are committed to reducing our plastic footprint globally and are proud of the success we have seen in 
recent years, such as the phase-out of plastic bags in our own retail stores globally in 2016 and the 
elimination of single-use plastics across the majority of adidas locations worldwide as of 2018. Where the 
use of plastics is still unavoidable, for example in transport packaging, adidas is working to find 
sustainable alternatives. For example, together with the global innovation platform ‘Fashion for Good’, the 
company is exploring the development of a recycling infrastructure for used polybags as well as innovative 
recycling processes for polybags, testing the technical feasibility of polybag circularity. In addition, the 
company aims to reduce its use of virgin plastic and is well on track to meet its goal to transition to the use 
of 100% recycled LDPE polybags by 2021. 
Circular business solutions 
adidas takes responsibility for the entire life cycle of a product and follows a clear game plan for moving 
toward a circular business model. Already in 2019, we successfully showcased proof-of-concept products 
against circular and regenerative loops by presenting our first fully recyclable and biofabricated products. 
Futurecraft.Loop is our first 100% recyclable performance shoe made entirely from one material (TPU), 
using no glue or solvent. To continue this journey, in 2020 we launched the Ultraboost DNA Loop as an 
evolution of the Futurecaft.Loop model and allocated 1,500 pairs to Creators Club members to help us 
develop the shoe further. The gained insights will help us refine the commercial launch of our first ‘made 
to be remade’ products in 2021. In addition, adidas is exploring infrastructure for product take-backs and 
recycling with partners and governmental bodies.

Product safety and integrity 
⌐ Product safety is an imperative. As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products 
that may result in injury to consumers or impair our image. To mitigate this risk, we have company-wide 
product safety policies in place that ensure we consistently apply physical and chemical product safety and 
conformity standards. 
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/PRODUCT-SAFETY 
The creation of respective adidas standards and policies is mostly a collaborative, cross-functional 
approach involving experts from the corporate Legal and Global Operations departments to ensure all 
aspects of a specific product are covered. This includes subsequent updates and training activities. 
Application and monitoring are ensured through our Global Operations function. 
One of these policies is the Restricted Substances Policy (‘A-01’ Policy) that we pioneered in 1998. It covers 
the strictest applicable local requirements and includes best-practice standards as recommended by 
consumer organizations. The policy is updated and published internally and externally at least once a year

based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with scientific organizations, and it is mandatory for all business 
partners. To ensure successful application of the policy across the business, we have established a 
Product Safety and Compliance workspace that serves as a platform for all employees involved in product 
creation by providing them with the necessary information and guidance to develop, produce and distribute 
products according to international regulations and best-practice standards. Both our own quality 
laboratories and external institutes are used to constantly monitor material samples for compliance with 
our requirements. Materials that do not meet our standards and specifications are rejected. As a result of 
our ongoing efforts, we did not record any product recalls in 2020.  
Over the last several years, we have substantially contributed to the AFIRM Restricted Substances List, 
which harmonizes restricted substances lists across the industry. While the uptake of the list as an 
industry best practice matured further, an assessment approach was initiated in cooperation with 
international third-party labs in 2020, to evaluate the testing performance and accreditation level of the 
labs we work with. This approach will ultimately also be made available to other customers of the labs. 
These are for instance companies from the textile and sporting goods industry and their suppliers. We also 
continued our participation in several major public stakeholder consultation processes initiated by the 
European Commission (e.g. European Chemicals Agency) and US state legislative initiatives to inform 
governmental entities on implications and opportunities of drafted legislation. 
¬ 
SOCIAL IMPACTS 
⌐ Through economic activities related to our business model, we create value that we need to balance 
with our environmental impact. However, being a company of our scale and global presence, we also have 
a social impact on our communities. adidas recognizes its responsibility to respect human rights and the 
importance of managing the appropriate due diligence to fulfill this obligation as a business. We do this by 
striving to operate responsibly along the entire value chain, by safeguarding the rights of our own 
employees and those of the workers who manufacture our products through our Workplace Standards, 
and by applying our influence to effect change wherever human rights issues are linked to our business 
activities. 
► SEE OUR PEOPLE 
Another aspect that we consider to be material in this context is our responsibility regarding tax. Through 
taxes, governments have the monetary ability to pursue their objectives and take on the responsibility of 
further developing their countries.
 ¬  
Human rights 
⌐ Since its inception in 1997, our human and labor rights program for our supply chain has been built on 
the back of intense stakeholder outreach and engagement, seeking to understand and define the most 
salient issues to address as a company. We
 continue to support improvements in the ongoing and 
independent accreditation of our own social compliance program by the Fair Labor Association (FLA). We 
have also maintained our commitment to the ‘Sporting Chance Principles’ and our place on the Advisory 
Council for the Centre for Sports and Human Rights. In 2020 we continued to hold a seat on FIFA’s 
Independent Advisory Board on Human Rights, providing input and recommendations to FIFA on the 
hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
 
Over the past year, increased attention has been given to potential forced labor risks linked to China’s 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). Several Western governments held hearings targeting 
business entities operating in the XUAR; the United States even imposed sanctions. Through its Modern 
Slavery Statement and other public disclosures, adidas shared the actions it has taken to address forced 
labor in its global supply chain. With respect to Xinjiang, adidas confirmed that it has never manufactured 
products in that region. As early as spring 2019, the company had already called on all Tier 2 material

suppliers to stop sourcing cotton yarn from the XUAR. Furthermore, adidas supported the Better Cotton 
Initiative (BCI), which is the primary source of adidas’ cotton, in its decision to no longer certify cotton that 
comes from Xinjiang.  
Five years after the launch of the modern slavery outreach program, we have reached an increased 
understanding of the potential risks associated with modern slavery in our upstream supply chain. In this 
time, we have engaged extensively on human rights and forced labor industry benchmarks and have 
identified and filled gaps in our policies and practices, which has led us to secure the highest ratings in 
those benchmarks. Through 2020, we strengthened engagement with our Tier 2 suppliers, employing 
foreign migrant workers as part of our Responsible Recruitment partnership with the International 
Organization for Migration and led joint remediation efforts at shared supplier sites with leading apparel 
and footwear brands. adidas was part of a twelve-member expert task force on forced labor and Decent 
Work, set up to provide recommendations to improve the Better Cotton Initiative’s effectiveness in 
identifying, preventing, mitigating, and remediating forced labor risks at the cotton farm level. In a multi-
stakeholder initiative from 2019 to 2020, we, along with other international brands, supported the FLA and 
International Organization for Migration in undertaking a supply chain mapping and labor rights 
assessment of the natural rubber sector in Vietnam.

Our approach to tax 
⌐ We are committed to being compliant with all tax regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
We consider the interests of our stakeholders in the business decisions we make in order to ensure the 
lasting success of our company.  
We do not operate through artificial structures or structure our business in ways that are intended to 
result in tax avoidance. Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our 
business activities in those jurisdictions, and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden. 
While tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our 
decision-making process. 
Tax management and governance 
Given the range of activities and locations we operate in, adidas is subject to a wide range of taxes across 
the world, including corporate income tax; VAT/GST; employee-related taxes, such as payroll and fringe 
benefit tax; withholding taxes; property taxes; stamp duties and other taxes. The purpose of our tax 
function is to support and enable business objectives while ensuring compliance and preventing or 
minimizing tax risks. 
The approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy, 
objectives, policies, and internal controls. Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and 
executing our tax strategy. The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with 
significant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CFO is ultimately accountable 
for compliance with our tax strategy.  
Pursuant to our tax policies, the local Directors and Management of each legal entity are responsible for 
ensuring compliance with tax regulations. The local teams are supported by the company’s Corporate Tax 
team and tax advisors. The Corporate Tax team exercises global governance and is accountable for our 
approach to tax. Its main responsibility is to provide global tax advisory, to identify and manage 
opportunities and risks and ensure tax compliance worldwide. Through partnering with business 
functions, the Corporate Tax team aims to understand the needs and perspectives of various stakeholders 
internally and externally and to support business objectives while ensuring continued compliance with tax 
regulations. Enquiries from and communication with external stakeholders regarding our tax affairs are 
managed in accordance with our Global Communication Guidelines.

Our Executive Board is updated on tax matters periodically, including a risk review process every six 
months that also forms part of our tax governance framework. Our CFO and/or the Executive Board, 
advised by the Corporate Tax team, is ultimately responsible for decisions on topics such as entering into 
significant or one-off transactions that may give rise to an increase in tax risk (e.g. mergers and 
acquisitions). 
Our ‘Fair Play Code of Conduct’ sets out the options available to employees who detect unlawful or 
unethical behavior, including anonymous notification or whistleblowing procedures. The adidas AG audit 
includes the audit of disclosures in respect to tax.

Interactions with tax authorities 
We seek a cooperative relationship with tax authorities. We respond to information requests, whether 
formal or informal, and, on a case-by-case basis decide whether to take the initiative in communicating 
business developments of particular significance to the local tax authorities. During 2020, we were not 
involved in the public policy regarding tax law or tax law changes in any of the jurisdictions we operate in. 
Tax planning 
We ensure that the tax profile of our activities is aligned with the substance of the operating structures of 
our business. Accordingly, transactions have commercial and economic substance and we do not put in 
place arrangements that are contrived or artificial. Our ‘Transfer Pricing Policy’ requires that intragroup 
transactions be carried out on an arm’s-length basis. As a result, our profits are derived and taxed in the 
jurisdictions where value is created.
 ¬ 
WORKING CONDITIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 
⌐ Managing the impact of covid-19 
From the very outset, adidas has sought to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 
workers in its global supply chain, providing guidance on infectious disease control, occupational safety 
and workers’ welfare. The company continued to uphold its standard manufacturing terms, including 
worker rights protection, and assisted key suppliers in securing bank financing to help them weather the  
covid-19 crisis. Ensuring business continuity and a functioning supply chain has kept workers in jobs, with 
the vast majority of our supplier factories having retained their workforce, albeit with reduced working 
hours due to lockdowns or suspensions. adidas continued to be committed to ensuring legal compliance in 
terms of pay and benefits for all workers and tracked the working conditions in each and every factory. 
Where we have seen factory downsizing, we ensured that laid-off workers received their legal severance 
and other entitlements in full.  
We recognized that these actions alone would not be enough and endorsed the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO) Call to Action to address the impact of coronavirus pandemic on the garment industry. 
The ILO convened a global working group, charged with securing funding to ensure business continuity, 
payment of wages, income support and job retention initiatives sufficient to protect garment workers’ 
income, health, and employment. The effort included a commitment to support the development and 
expansion of social protection systems for workers and employers in the garment industry, consistent with 
recommendation ILO 202.  
adidas’ covid-19 response was assessed by the labor rights advocacy community, which includes the 
Worker Rights Consortium and duly recognized in Baptist World Aid Australia’s ‘2020 Covid Fashion 
Report’ which surveyed close to 100 brands on their commitment to address the covid-19 crisis in their 
supply chain.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Our approach to working conditions in our supply chain 
⌐ Our commitment to ensuring fair labor practices and safe working conditions in factories throughout 
our global supply chain is fundamental to our human rights approach. Our active efforts are guided by the 
adidas Workplace Standards, our supply chain code of conduct. The standards form a contractual 
obligation under the manufacturing agreements we sign with our suppliers to ensure workers’ health and 
safety and environmentally sound factory operations by following ILO and United Nations conventions 
relating to human rights and employment practices, as well as the model code of conduct of the World 
Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI). We also seek to extend our reach by cascading 
responsibilities to our partners, to capture and address potential and actual risks related to possible labor 
rights violations upstream and downstream of our product creation. Specific reference to the code 
provisions of the ILO core labor conventions is provided in the adidas Guidelines on Employment 
Standards. The Sourcing and Social & Environmental Affairs (SEA) senior management reviews and 
approves all policies and implementation processes of the labor rights program. 
Our social compliance program continues to evolve, and is built around three core concepts:  
─ Performance: In 2021, we will transition from our compliance benchmark (C-KPI), which is focused on 
management systems and supplier self-governance, to a new set of social indicators (S-KPI) that 
measure outcomes such as reduced accident rates, higher retention levels, or improved worker 
satisfaction. Through our new S-KPI tool, we will report annually on workplace conditions, including 
the effectiveness of our worker empowerment initiatives. The targets for 2025 will be defined in 2021. 
─ Transparency: As part of our broader risk management processes, we will increase the scope and 
application of Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) efforts. Our 2025 ambition is to achieve a 100% 
coverage of all ‘at risk’ activities, ensuring HRDD compliance is embedded across the organization. ‘At 
risk’ activities are those activities identified in our annual human rights risk mapping and flagged as 
having potential adverse human rights impacts that require prevention or mitigation. 
─ Fairness: The focus lies on gender equality, pay equity and responsible sourcing practices that support 
fair compensation for workers. Our ambition is to see progressive improvement across all fair 
compensation benchmarks and achieve gender wage parity for workers and their supervisors in each 
of our strategic Tier 1 suppliers by 2025. 
¬ 
Factory performance 
⌐ We regularly assess factories on their ability to provide fair, healthy and environmentally sound 
workplace conditions by conducting announced and unannounced audits through our own team and 
accredited external auditors. We use a KPI rating system for social compliance (C-KPI) and attach scores 
between ‘1’ and ‘5’, with ‘1’ being the worst and ‘5’ being the best. According to the results, our sourcing 
and SEA teams jointly decide the course of action, ranging from trainings to enforcement actions, such as 
sending warning letters or hiring external consultants to help improve their program. 
 
Any cases of non-compliance identified during audits are given a certain time frame for remediation. 
Potential new factories are assessed in a similar way and orders can only be placed if approval by the SEA 
team has been granted. We operate several grievance channels allowing workers or third parties to 
submit complaints about violations of the Workplace Standards and human rights generally. All third-party 
complaints are reviewed and investigated, and the outcome is reported on our corporate website. Factory 
conditions are also inspected by independent auditors through our participation in the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA), which we joined as a founding member in 1999, demonstrating our commitment to 
independent and unannounced factory inspections and external verification of our programs. Since then, 
our program has been accredited three times by the FLA.

At the end of 2020, adidas worked with 520 independent supplier facilities
1 16
 (2019: 631) that manufacture 
products for our company in 49 countries (2019: 52). The decrease is due to our overall ambition to further 
consolidate our supply chain, mostly in South Korea in 2020. Our intention is to work with fewer factories, 
forming long-term partnerships and provide them with more orders. 66% of our suppliers’ factories (2019: 
69%) are located in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of licensees we worked with declined slightly 
compared to 2019, with 56 licensees (2019: 62) that manufactured products in 375 factories (2019: 372)

Onboarding 
⌐ In 2020, our primary focus has been on maintaining partnerships with our existing suppliers rather than 
onboarding new ones. We conducted initial assessments, the first approval stage for a new entry into our 
supply chain or, in the case of existing sites, where there is the construction of new facilities, in 
112 factories (2019: 143). Of these, 31 factories (2019: 49 factories) were either rejected directly after the 
initial assessment identified zero-tolerance issues, or were ‘rejected with a second visit’ due to 
identification of one or more threshold issues, which means they were rejected but given the chance to 
remediate the non-compliance issues within a specific timeframe. The vast majority (94%) of all initial 
assessments were undertaken in Asia (2019: 84%), with China accounting for 50% (2019: 38%).

Overall, at the end of 2020, the ‘first-time rejection rate’ of 28% of all new factories visited was slightly 
lower than in the previous year (2019: 34%). Onboarding fewer factories, and providing focused support to 
those we have onboarded, has aided us in also lowering the ‘final rejection rate’, to below 2% in 2020. The 
remediation of factory issues is beneficial for workers as it raises the bar in terms of better and timelier 
pay, improved benefits, reduced hours, and the legal protection of formal employment contracts, and it 
results in significant improvements in basic health and safety within the workplace. Suppliers that have 
threshold issues are normally given three months to remediate those issues before being re-audited for 
final acceptance. 
¬ 
Worker engagement and empowerment 
⌐ Since 2017 we have reduced our reliance on local worker hotlines as a complaint mechanism, by 
building an application-based ‘Workers Voice’ platform: a bespoke, factory-based digital grievance 
channel for workers. We have progressively improved and expanded the use of this operational grievance 
mechanism and in 2020 almost 450,000 workers employed in 111 factories across twelve countries had 
access to this system. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, two strategic suppliers had to postpone the 
implementation of the platform, which is why we missed our 2020 target of having the ‘Workers Voice’ 
platform implemented at 100% of our strategic suppliers.  
 
16 Independent supplier facilities refer to individual Tier 1 facilities (factories) of our manufacturing partners (suppliers) that adidas has a manufacturing 
agreement with, and their Tier 1 subcontractor facilities, excluding own factories and licensee facilities. Facilities that work with our licensees are reported 
separately. Some of these facilities may produce both for adidas directly and for licensees.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
A robust grievance mechanism is the fulcrum on which workers can raise their concerns and secure 
remedies. Access to a digital complaint mechanism proved invaluable during covid-19, with a 128% 
increase in worker grievances being reported. Close to 46,000 human and labor rights complaints were 
filed in 2020. The top three types of complaints were related to concerns over benefits, general facilities 
and communication. 98% of these complaints were successfully resolved by the factory management.   
Responses received through the ‘Workers Voice’ platform are carefully tracked by adidas, using KPIs and 
dashboard reviews, case satisfaction ratings and on-site worker interviews. This allows us to evaluate the 
efficacy of the grievance channels, see major cases in real time and undertake timely interventions, where 
necessary. It also helps us understand the main challenges and labor rights issues in a factory and track 
how the factory management and their HR teams resolve cases and communicate their findings. Our 
evaluation contributes to the factory's overall social compliance score. adidas provides ongoing capacity 
building to enhance the factory teams’ capability to improve the effectiveness of the grievance mechanism. 
It is notable that the case satisfaction rate, which allows workers to input their level of satisfaction with the 
resolution of complaints, has risen steadily from 39% in 2019 to 58% in 2020.

Complementing the various grievance channels, we rolled out the ‘Worker Pulse’ project in 2020, a 
digitalized short survey to capture workers’ perception and awareness of their labor rights on focused 
areas such as communication, harassment and abuse and grievance systems. We undertook these digital 
surveys in 63 factories across nine countries, with more than 22,000 workers voluntarily participating. The 
survey was conveyed to the workers through a mobile-phone-based application. 
Of the participating workers, 78.6% reported their willingness to recommend their workplaces to their 
friends and relatives as a favorable place to work, and 77% believed that complaints raised through the 
grievance mechanisms are taken seriously by factory management. Factories are required to develop and 
track workplace improvement plans, based on the feedback received from the ‘Worker Pulse’. 
 
The ‘Worker Pulse’ builds on our existing Worker Satisfaction Survey (WSS) process, which was first 
launched in 2016. WSS is a comprehensive survey consisting of around 60 questions that helps suppliers 
gain insights into the workplace environment, from both a worker’s and a supervisor’s perspective, and 
target those areas requiring improvement. For example, workers are asked for their feedback on the 
effectiveness and performance of their factory grievance mechanisms, which in turn helps inform ways to 
improve and further refine those systems. 
Alongside factory-led training, we have also offered tailored training under our Women Leadership 
Program (WLP), first launched in 2016. As of the end of 2019, more than 1,300 workers had participated in 
this program. The WLP provides training and skill-sharing sessions, managed through a Women 
Supervisor Forum (WSF): a platform for female supervisors to upgrade their knowledge, learn best 
practices, and gain support, information and guidance on a range of topics to improve their abilities as a 
supervisor. With the arrival of the global pandemic, opportunities for face-to-face training in the factories 
were severely constrained. As a result, only 195 supervisors were able to take part in the WLP skills 
training program in 2020, and the expanded rollout of the WSF had to be paused.

Factory engagements and training sessions 
⌐ In 2020, just as our ability to conduct onsite audits was restricted by the pandemic, so was our capacity 
to engage in onsite visits and training sessions at our suppliers. We addressed this by increasing our levels 
of remote, or virtual engagements throughout the year, increasing from 426 individual factory 
engagements in 2019, to 644 in 2020. In addition to our continuous tracking of covid-19 impacts on 
suppliers’ operations, these engagements covered monitoring of remediation activity, KPI improvement 
plans, grievance investigations and worker satisfaction surveys, as well as our regular supplier training 
programs, where it was practical to do so. Nevertheless, some of our programs could not continue at the 
same levels, in the absence of face-to-face training workshops. In total, through our fundamental, 
performance, and sustainability training sessions, we conducted 61 training sessions and workshops for 
suppliers, licensees, workers and adidas employees (2019: 123). Where virtual training sessions could be 
held, we were able to attract larger audiences, reaching a total of 1,497 people, only slightly down from the 
2019 figure of 1,697.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
As part of our efforts to scale the adoption of renewable energy within our supply chain, we conducted an 
extensive training on ‘How to perform a solar PV rooftop feasibility study and installation’ (also known as 
‘Rooftop Solar Guideline’) which was translated into four languages. The training provided a 
comprehensive overview for suppliers to facilitate the transition to renewable energy, reducing scope 1 
and 2 emissions, and eventually supporting commitments to the UNFCCC targets. The objectives of the 
training were to ensure consistency across the entire adidas supply chain, provide guidance on how to 
select a vendor, or conduct feasibility studies, among others. It covered two main sections: the feasibility 
study and the installation process.  
Also in 2020, adidas launched the adidas Chemical Management (aCM) training, conducting 15 training 
sessions in China and Taiwan with 141 participants. Through this chemical management academy our aim 
is to: 
─ ensure facilities have the right competence and responsibility on site to manage the facilities’ 
operation  
─ enable facilities to implement a chemical management system in the production process on a long-
term basis 
─ share best practice/available technology among industry peers, and 
─ drive continuous improvement ¬ 
Monitoring 
⌐ We audit our suppliers regularly against our Workplace Standards. In 2020, however, we had to adjust 
our monitoring approach to accommodate covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions. Where possible, we 
continued to follow our regular onsite assessments, including wastewater testing, while also piloting the 
use of remote ‘Desktop Assessments’. Of the total 921 social compliance audits and environmental 
assessments conducted in 2020 (2019: 1,191), 128 were conducted remotely. Despite the constraints 
imposed by covid-19, we successfully completed 256 test assessments according to the ZDHC Wastewater 
Guidelines (2019: 234), which also count toward our environmental assessments.  
In  2020,  88  self-governance  audits  and  collaboration  audits  (2019:102)  were  conducted.  When  a  factory  
reaches  a  compliance  maturity  level  of  4C  or  above,  we  empower  the  supplier  to  conduct  their  own  self-
governance audits and develop appropriate remediation plans, which we periodically review. Collaboration 
audits are conducted in partnership with other brands, or as part of joint remediation exercises. The number 
of audits in factories manufacturing goods for licensees decreased slightly from 317 in 2019 to 278 in 2020.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Our audits help us rate our suppliers according to their social and environmental compliance performance 
with a C-KPI and E-KPI rating tool, respectively. As we continue to increase our focus on added-value 
advisory services and empowerment projects, which go beyond our regular audit routine, the number of 
audits conducted by our own in-house team has decreased to 251 in 2020 (2019: 299). Similarly, audits 
conducted by third-party monitors also decreased to 612 at the end of 2020 (2019: 658). 
─  Audit coverage: A total of 48% (2019: 49%) of all direct and licensee facilities were audited in 2020. 
‘High-risk’ locations in Asia, which is the most significant sourcing region for adidas, were the subject 
of extensive monitoring in 2020, with an audit coverage close to 64% (2019: 75%). As a general 
principle, factories located in high-risk countries are 100% covered in our auditing scope, which means 
they receive audits annually (unless they are rated as ‘self-governing', in which case they are subject to 
audits every two years), while low-risk countries with strong government enforcement and 
inspectorate systems, such as Germany, are considered out of scope for our audit coverage.  
─ Audit results: In 2020, 91% of our strategic factories achieved a rating of 4C or better, compared to 
54% of all direct factories. This exceeded our 2020 target, which called for 80% of our strategic 
suppliers to reach 4C or above. As such, these higher ratings show that our strategic suppliers have 
continued to strengthen their compliance performance, despite the headwinds created by covid-19. 
Some 12% of our strategic suppliers’ factories have progressed even further, achieving a 5C rating, 
which shows that they have mature social compliance governance systems and practices in place.

Non-compliances identified in active factories 
⌐ Our suppliers’ factories are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues. While threshold 
issues are considered serious but correctable non-compliances that can be addressed in a specified 
timeframe through remedial action, zero-tolerance issues – such as forced labor, child labor practices and 
critical life-threatening health, safety and environment conditions – immediately trigger a warning and 
potential disqualification of a supplier. Over the course of each year, we continuously track the non-
compliance findings identified through suppliers’ performance audits, collaboration audits, self-
governance assessments and, as of 2020, Social & Labor Convergence Program (SLCP) assessments. We 
follow up on all cases of non-compliance and require our suppliers to remediate open issues within a 
specified timeframe. As can be seen below, the identified issues in 2020 remained largely the same as 
those reported in 2019. 
─ Non-compliances in the area of labor: Besides identifying non-compliances with the Workplace 
Standards, our team focuses on the use and effectiveness of the factories’ HR management systems, 
including any gaps in policies and procedures, related to specific risk areas, such as forced labor, child 
labor, freedom of association or discrimination. As a result, the percentages shown indicate the 
systemic shortcomings of active factories, rather than the confirmed presence of a specific case of 
non-compliance.

Independent FLA audits 
⌐ Due to covid-19 related restrictions, unannounced and independent assessments by the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA) were heavily limited resulting in one Sustainable Compliance assessment for the year 
for adidas. Nevertheless, FLA focused its efforts on:   
─ supporting company affiliates’ ability to manage covid-19-related risks by issuing various 
guidance notes to address labor and health- and safety-related risks resulting from the 
pandemic,  
─ continuing capacity building on responsible recruitment and forced labor,  
─ issuing guidance to prevent forced labor risks and issuing statements on sourcing in Xinjiang, and 
─ completing a comprehensive review and update to the FLA Compliance Benchmarks. ¬  
Enforcement 
⌐ Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered when we find 
ongoing serious non-compliance issues that need to be addressed by our suppliers’ factories. We work 
closely with our suppliers to help them improve their performance. However, where we face situations of 
severe or repeated non-compliance, we do terminate business relationships with factories. 
─ Warning letters: In 2020, our close engagement with our supplier’ factories has helped reduce the 
number of active warning letters to 22 (2019: 41) across ten countries. Compared to the previous year, 
the overall number of active first-warning letters decreased significantly, from 34 in 2019 to 19 in 2020; 
the total number of second warnings also decreased to 3 in 2020 (2019: 6).   Factories that receive 
second-warning letters are only one step away from being notified of possible termination of the 
manufacturing agreement and are subject to focused monitoring by our SEA team. No third-warning 
letters (which result in factory terminations) were issued to our suppliers in 2020 (2019: 1). 
─ Terminations: In 2020, we had no terminations of supplier agreements for social or environmental 
compliance reasons (2019: 2).

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
We are committed to generating shareholder value. We strive to create value by converting sales and 
profit growth into strong operating cash flow, while at the same time managing our asset base 
proactively. Our company’s planning and controlling system is therefore designed to provide a variety of 
tools to assess our current performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to best 
utilize commercial and organizational opportunities in the interest of our shareholders. While this focus 
on creating shareholder value will remain, the launch of our new strategy ‘Own the Game’ for the period 
until 2025 will have an impact on the internal management system, which will be adjusted accordingly in 
the course of 2021. 
► S SGY 
Impact of the covid-19 pandemic  
In 2020, adidas faced serious challenges arising from the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Throughout the year, sports events were canceled, a significant number of stores were closed and many of 
our employees were confined to working from home. We saw a material decline in sales from our physical 
channels and a corresponding reduction in cash. This unprecedented situation led to a temporary 
adjustment of our internal management system and required a strong focus on the most important 
priorities: 
─ Ensuring the health and safety of our employees, consumers, wholesale customers and partners. 
─ Safeguarding the liquidity of our company through a strict focus on cash flows and financing activities. 
─ Doubling  down  on  our  e-commerce  business  to  drive  net  sales  and  cash  generation  in  times  of  store  
closures and reduced retail traffic. 
Internal management system designed to drive shareholder value 
In order to drive and steer the creation of shareholder value, the company’s Management focuses on a set 
of major financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Sales and operating profit growth, paired with a 
focus on management of operating working capital, are the main contributors to operating cash flow 
improvements. At the same time, value-enhancing capital expenditure benefits future operating profit and 
cash flow development. In addition, the development of the company’s net income from continued 
operations position as well as of earnings per share (EPS) is of high importance as it directly drives 
returns in the interest of our shareholders.
 Our strong focus on shareholder value creation is reflected in 
the fact that our Management’s variable compensation is closely linked to the company’s growth in sales, 
profitability and net income from continued operations. 
► SEE COMPENSATION REPORT 
Operating margin as major KPI for operational progress 
Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of net sales) is one of our company’s major 
KPIs to drive and improve our operational performance. It highlights the quality of our top line and 
operational efficiency. The primary drivers to enhance operating margin are as follows: 
─ Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses on identifying and exploiting growth 
opportunities that not only provide for future top-line improvements, but also have potential to 
increase our gross margin. Major levers for enhancing our sales and gross margin include: 
─ Planning pricing and clearance activities according to market realities. 
─ Optimizing our product and channel mix.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
─ Improving the quality of distribution, with a particular focus on our direct-to-consumer business. 
─ Operating expense control: Management puts high emphasis on tightly controlling operating expenses 
to leverage sales growth through to the bottom line. This requires a particular focus on ensuring 
flexibility in the company’s cost base. This flexibility helped us in managing through the covid-19 
pandemic in 2020, where we adopted a disciplined approach to both marketing and operating overhead 
expenses. More broadly, marketing expenditure is one of our largest operating expenses and at the 
same time one of the most important mechanisms for driving brand desirability and top-line growth 
sustainably. Therefore, we are committed to improving the efficiency of our marketing investments. 
This includes concentrating our communication efforts on key global brand initiatives and focusing our 
promotion spend on well-selected partnerships with top events, leagues, clubs, federations, athletes, 
and artists. We also aim to increase operational efficiency by tightly managing operating overhead 
expenses. In this respect, we regularly review our operational structure – harmonizing business 
processes, standardizing systems, eliminating redundancies, and leveraging the scale of our 
organization. 
Tight cash flow and operating working capital management 
In 2020, with at times a large portion of our own as well as our wholesale customers’ store fleet closed, a 
clear focus on liquidity, cash flow and operating working capital was even more important compared to a 
normal business environment. This required a close monitoring of the cash and working capital situation 
and disciplined execution of mitigation measures to manage the company through the crisis. Generally, 
due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our business, the efficiency of the balance 
sheet depends to a large degree on our operating working capital management. Operating working capital 
comprises accounts receivable plus inventories minus accounts payable. 
► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION 
AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
In this context, our key metric is average operating working capital as a percentage of net sales. 
Monitoring the development of this metric facilitates the measurement of our progress in improving the 
efficiency of our business cycle. 
We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market demand and ensure fast 
replenishment. Inventory aging is controlled carefully to reduce inventory obsolescence and to minimize 
clearance activities. As a result, Inventory Days Lasting (IDL) is monitored and assessed regularly as it 
measures the average number of days goods remain in inventory before being sold, highlighting the 
efficiency of capital locked up in products. To optimize capital tied up in accounts receivable, we strive to 
improve collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) and improve the aging of 
accounts receivable. Likewise, we strive to optimize payment terms with our suppliers to best manage our 
accounts payable. 
 
Capital expenditure targeted to maximize future returns 
Improving the effectiveness of capital expenditure is another major lever to maximize our operating cash 
flow. We control capital expenditure with a top-down, bottom-up approach. In a first step, Management 
defines focus areas within the framework of our strategy and an overall investment budget based on 
investment requests from various functions within the organization. Then, in a second step, our operating 
segments align their initiatives within the scope of assigned priorities and available budget. We evaluate 
potential return on planned investments utilizing the net present value method. Risk is accounted for, 
adding a risk premium to the cost of capital, and thus reducing our estimated future earnings streams 
where appropriate. By means of scenario planning, the sensitivity of investment returns is tested against 
changes in initial assumptions. For large investment projects, timelines and deviations versus budget are 
monitored on a monthly basis throughout the course of the project. In addition to optimizing return on

investments, we evaluate larger projects upon completion and document learnings for future capital 
expenditure decisions. 
Focus on net income in the interest of our shareholders 
Beyond our ambition to maximize operating cash flow, we are committed to a continuous improvement in 
the company’s bottom line. Management closely monitors the development of both net income from 
continued operations and earnings per share (EPS) and executes against these two KPIs. Our strong focus 
on driving sustainable expansion to the company’s bottom line is also reflected in the fact that, as part of 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018/2020, the variable compensation for our Management is directly linked 
to the growth of the company’s net income from continued operations. 
Non-financial key performance indicators 
In addition to the major financial KPIs to assess the performance and operational success of our company, 
as outlined above, we have identified a set of non-financial KPIs that help us track our progress in areas 
that are critical for our long-term success but are not directly reflected in the financial statements. These 
non-financial KPIs are assessed on a regular basis and managed by the respective business functions. 
Non-financial KPIs which we are closely monitoring include, among others, market share, backlogs and 
sell-through data as well as our customer delivery performance (On-Time In-Full), employee engagement 
and a set of KPIs in the area of our sustainability performance. 
Net Promoter Score (NPS): 
⌐ Maintaining and enhancing brand desirability through the creation of strong 
brand identities is crucial for sustaining and driving profitable growth. Therefore, mainly on a market and 
category level, we invest in primary qualitative and quantitative research such as trend scouting and 
consumer surveys to determine brand loyalty and brand strength. Measures that are tracked include 
brand awareness, likeability, and purchase intent. 
Furthermore, within the framework of ‘Creating the New’, we have implemented an NPS system, which 
strengthened our capabilities to more carefully review brand advocacy as NPS tells us how likely it is that 
consumers will recommend our brands. Our efforts around NPS (both our own NPS as well as the NPS of 
our major competitors) are driven by an independent agency and monitored by our internal global 
consumer insights teams on a regular basis. In addition, NPS is measured across many of our own-retail 
stores as well as our own e-commerce platform.  
Given the exceptional circumstances in 2020, NPS has only served as a KPI until the end of the first 
quarter. Amid a global pandemic and with a new strategic cycle ahead, the company decided to stop 
gathering NPS data through our external provider. 
¬ 
Market share: To measure the operational performance of our brands relative to our major competitors, 
we continuously collect, on a market and category level, market share data. The findings provide detailed 
insights for our senior management team regarding in which markets and categories we have been able to 
gain market share relative to our peers, enabling us to leverage those insights across the organization. In 
addition, the results help us to define clear roles and responsibilities for each of our markets and 
categories within our long-term strategic aspirations, based on their overall positioning within the sporting 
goods industry. 
► SEE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTLOOK 
Backlogs and sell-through data: To manage demand planning and better anticipate our future 
performance, backlogs comprising orders received up to nine months in advance of the actual sale are 
monitored closely. However, due to the growing share of own retail (including our own e-commerce 
channel) in our business mix, fluctuating order patterns among our customers as well as an increasing 
part of our business being realized under significantly shortened lead times, orders received from our

qualitative feedback from our retail partners on the sell-through success of our products at the point of 
sale as well as such data received from our own-retail activities is becoming increasingly important. 
On-Time In-Full (OTIF): OTIF measures the company’s delivery performance toward customers and our 
own-retail stores. Managed by our Global Operations function, OTIF assesses to what degree customers 
received what they ordered and if they received it on time. It helps us to investigate improvement potential 
in the area of order book management and logistics processes. It therefore also helps us to improve our 
delivery performance, which is a major aspect when it comes to customer satisfaction. The OTIF 
assessment covers most of our key markets.

Employee engagement: 
⌐ To measure the level of engagement and motivation of our employees, adidas 
carries out employee engagement surveys. These surveys aim to provide key insights into how well we, as 
an employer, are doing in engaging our employees. They thus enable us to develop the right focus and 
future people strategies across our organization, helping us to create a world-class employee experience 
and continue to attract and retain top talent.
¬ ► SEE OUR PEOPLE 
Sustainability performance: We have a strong commitment to enhance the social and environmental 
performance of our company. By doing so, we firmly believe we will not only improve the company’s 
overall reputation, but also increase its economic value. We therefore follow a comprehensive roadmap 
with clear targets and regularly track our progress toward these targets. A major focus lies on measuring 
the environmental footprint of our own sites globally as well as monitoring and rating our supplier 
factories with regard to social and environmental compliance with our Workplace Standards. We have a 
strong track record in sustainability disclosure, providing regular updates about our sustainability 
performance in this Annual Report as well as on our corporate website.

Structured performance measurement system 
We have developed an extensive performance measurement system, which utilizes a variety of tools to 
measure the company’s performance. Key performance indicators as well as other important financial 
metrics are regularly monitored and compared against initial targets as well as rolling forecasts on a 
monthly basis. When negative deviations exist between actual and target numbers, we perform a detailed 
analysis to identify and address the cause. If necessary, action plans are implemented to optimize the 
development of our operating performance. To assess current sales and profitability development, 
Management continuously analyzes the performance of our operating segments. We also benchmark our 
financial results with those of our major competitors on a regular basis. 
Taking into account year-to-date performance as well as opportunities and risks, the company’s expected 
full-year financial performance is assessed on a monthly basis. In this respect, backlogs and sell-through 
data as well as feedback from customers and own-retail stores are also assessed where available. Finally, 
as a further early indicator for future performance, the results of any relevant recent market and 
consumer research are assessed as available. 
In view of the covid-19 pandemic, the situation required that we adjusted to the greater information needs 
of senior management within this time of uncertainty through e.g. more frequent forecasts to ensure the 
quality of decision making. In 2020 overall, our performance management system has proven to be 
effective.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE 
While adidas recorded strong operational improvements in 2020, exceptional growth in e-commerce 
could only partially compensate for temporary physical store closures. Revenues decreased 14% on a 
currency-neutral basis, reflecting double-digit declines at both the adidas and Reebok brands. 
Revenues in Russia/CIS remained flat, while currency-neutral sales were down in all other major 
market segments. The gross margin decreased 2.3 percentage points to 49.7%. Other operating 
expenses as a percentage of sales were up 4.9 percentage points to 46.5%, predominantly due to higher 
operating overhead expenses as a percentage of sales. The company’s operating margin decreased 
7.5 percentage points to 3.8%, reflecting the decrease in both gross margin and other operating 
expenses as a percentage of sales. The financial results were significantly impacted by the negative 
effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Net income from continuing operations decreased 78% to € 429 
million. This translates into basic EPS from continuing operations of € 2.15, representing a decrease of 
78% versus the prior year period. 
ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 
Global economy slumps in 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic
17
 
The global economy slipped into a recession in 2020, with global gross domestic product (GDP) contracting 
4.3%. Despite recent progress in the development of effective vaccines, the spread of the coronavirus 
continued to overwhelm policy makers and health care systems alike. Far-reaching lockdown measures 
and other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus led to a contraction in output, consumption, and 
trade. Developed economies declined 5.4% in 2020 mainly driven by sharp declines in the demand and 
supply of services, despite unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy accommodation. Developing 
economies in aggregate were down 2.6% amid a slump in private consumption and retail sales. 
Furthermore, consumer confidence plummeted amid falling labor incomes and rising unemployment 
rates. Across the globe, risks of re-escalating trade tensions and a delay in the pandemic recovery remain. 
Sporting goods industry negatively impacted in 2020 
The global sporting goods industry was adversely affected by lockdown and quarantine measures across 
many parts of the world for the majority of 2020. Demand for sporting goods was pressured amid 
disturbed consumer purchasing behavior due to the drop in economic activity, cancellations of major 
sports events and physical stores partially closed. Even as stores re-opened, traffic rates remained below 
prior year levels due to necessary hygiene and safety measures. These adverse impacts were partially 
compensated by the acceleration of existing global trends such as increasing penetration of sportswear 
(‘athleisure’) as well as rising awareness for health and wellness. Moreover, purchasing behavior 
continued to shift toward online channels and sustainability remained a predominant theme. Ultimately, 
the evolution of digital platforms, such as social fitness or membership programs with seamless personal 
experiences, facilitated consumer dialogue and brand building in times of social distancing. For the 
sporting goods industry, too, risks of re-escalating trade tensions and a delay in the pandemic recovery 
remain.

Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for expenses associated with producing and 
delivering our products. In addition, own-production expenses are also included in the cost of sales. 
However, these expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales. In 2020, cost of sales 
was € 9.990 billion, representing a decrease of 12% compared to the prior year level of € 11.347 billion. 
This development mainly reflects the revenue shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Gross margin down 2.3 percentage points  
In 2020, gross profit decreased 20% to € 9.855 billion from € 12.293 billion in 2019, representing a gross 
margin decrease of 2.3 percentage points to 49.7% (2019: 52.0%). While a more favorable channel mix due 
to the exceptional e-commerce growth as well as lower sourcing costs had a positive effect on gross 
margin, a less favorable pricing mix due to increased promotional activity and negative currency 
fluctuations weighed on the development in 2020. In addition, an increase in inventory allowances as well 
as purchase order cancellation costs related to the coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the 
gross margin development.

Other operating expenses as a percentage of sales up 4.9 percentage points 
Other operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization, mainly consist of marketing and point-
of-sale, distribution and selling as well as general and administration expenses. In 2020, other operating 
expenses were down 6% to € 9.229 billion (2019: € 9.843 billion). As a percentage of sales, other operating 
expenses increased 4.9 percentage points to 46.5% from 41.6% in 2019. Marketing and point-of-sale 
expenses amounted to € 2.573 billion in 2020 compared to € 3.042 billion in the prior year, representing a 
decrease of 15% compared to the 2019 level. As a percentage of sales, marketing and point-of-sale 
expenses increased 0.1 percentage points to 13.0% (2019: 12.9%). Distribution and selling expenses 
decreased 1% to € 4.962 billion in 2020 from € 4.997 billion in the prior year, due to lower personnel costs 
as a result of temporary store closures, as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses. As a 
percentage of sales, distribution and selling expenses increased 3.9 percentage points to 25.0% from 
21.1% in 2019. General and administration expenses were down 12% to € 1.461 billion (2019:

allowances. On a currency-neutral basis, receivables were down 21%. Other current financial assets 
increased to € 702 million (2019: € 544 million), mainly due to an increase in custom claims and short-

Total non-current liabilities increased 14% to € 5.535 billion at the end of December 2020 from 
€ 4.868 billion in the prior year, reflecting various bond placements in the second half of the year. 
Consequently, long-term borrowings were up 56% to € 2.482 billion at the end of December 2020 from 
€ 1.595 billion in the prior year. Non-current lease liabilities decreased 10% to € 2.159 billion at the end of 
December 2020 from € 2.399 billion in the prior year, due to temporary store closures as well as currency 
effects. Other non-current financial liabilities were up 24% to € 115 million at the end of December 2020 
from € 92 million in the prior year. Other non-current provisions decreased 11% to € 229 million at the 
end of December 2020 from € 257 million in the prior year, mainly as a result of reduced provisions for 
personnel. 
► SEE NOTE 24  
Shareholders’ equity decreased 5% to € 6.454 billion at the end of December 2020 versus € 6.796 billion in 
2019, mainly due to the share repurchases at the beginning of the year. Consequently, the equity ratio

Operating working capital 
Operating working capital decreased 1% to € 3.960 billion at the end of December 2020 compared to 
€ 4.007 billion in 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, operating working capital was up 8%. Average 
operating working capital as a percentage of sales increased 5.4 percentage points to 23.5% (2019: 18.1%), 
as a result of temporary store closures which led to a revenue decline and corresponding higher inventory.

Investment analysis 
Capital expenditure is defined as the total cash expenditure for the purchase of tangible and intangible 
assets (excluding acquisitions and right-of-use assets according to IFRS 16). Capital expenditure 
decreased 38% to € 442 million (2019: € 711 million). Capital expenditure for property, plant and 
equipment was down 37% to € 378 million compared to € 599 million in the prior year. The company 
invested € 64 million in intangible assets, representing a 43% decrease compared to the prior year (2019: 
€ 112 million). Depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment losses and reversal of impairment 
losses of tangible and intangible assets, increased 10% to € 561 million in 2020 (2019: € 511 million). 
Controlled space initiatives, which comprise investments in new or remodeled own-retail and franchise 
stores as well as in shop-in-shop presentations of our brands and products in our customers’ stores, 
accounted for 42% of total capital expenditure (2019: 47%). Expenditure for IT and logistics represented 
14% and 8%, respectively (2019: 13% and 6%, respectively). In addition, expenditure for administration 
accounted for 4% (2019: 7%). Other investments mainly reflected the further development of our corporate 
facilities in Portland. These represented 31% of total capital expenditure (2019: 26%). From a segmental 
perspective, the majority of the capital expenditure was recorded centrally at headquarter level, which 
accounted for 49% (2019: 44%). In addition, capital expenditure in Asia-Pacific accounted for 29% (2019: 
24%) of the total capital expenditure, followed by North America with 8% (2019: 9%), Europe with 7% (2019: 
12%), Emerging Markets with 3% (2019: 3%) as well as Latin America with 2% (2019: 5%) and Russia/CIS

Liquidity analysis 
In 2020, net cash generated from operating activities decreased to € 1.486 billion (2019: € 2.819 billion). 
Net cash generated from continuing operating activities decreased to € 1.489 billion (2019: € 2.828 billion). 
This decrease was due to significantly lower income before taxes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
 
Net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in continuing investing activities decreased to 
€ 115 million each (2019: € 925 million). This development was mainly due to reduced investing activities 
in 2020 related to expenditures for property, plant and equipment, such as investments in controlled space 
initiatives and IT systems, and proceeds from the sale of short-term financial assets in 2020 compared to 
investments in 2019. Net cash generated from financing activities and net cash generated from continuing 
financing activities amounted to € 479 million each (2019: € 2.273 billion net cash used). This development 
was mainly due to the placement of two bonds in an amount of € 500 million each, the placement of a 
sustainability bond in an amount of € 500 million and the suspension of both the dividend payment and the 
share buyback program in 2020. 
Exchange rate effects negatively impacted the company’s cash position by € 75 million (2019: 
€ 30 million).

2019. The company’s ratio of adjusted net borrowings over EBITDA amounted to 1.5 at the end of 
December 2020 (2019: 1.1). In 2020, the definition of the ratio net borrowings over EBITDA was changed to 
adjusted net borrowings over EBITDA to reflect changes in the company’s Financial Policy. The most 
significant difference between the previous net debt definition and the new adjusted net borrowing 
definition is the inclusion of the present value of future lease and pension liabilities.

TREASURY 
Corporate financing policy 
In order to be able to meet the company’s payment commitments at all times, the major goal of our 
financial policy is to ensure adidas’ solvency, to limit financing risks and to balance financing costs with 
financial flexibility. The operating activities of our segments and the resulting cash inflows represent the 
company’s main source of liquidity. Liquidity is planned on a rolling quarterly basis under a multi-year 
financial and liquidity plan.  
Treasury policy and responsibilities 
Our Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issues, including banking policy and approval of bank 
relationships, financing arrangements and liquidity/asset management, currency, interest, commodity and 
equity risk management as well as the management of intercompany cash flows. Responsibilities are 
arranged in a three-tiered approach: 
─ The Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board and other senior executives who 
decide on the Treasury Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related topics. 
Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior approval of the Treasury Committee. 
─ The Treasury department is responsible for specific centralized treasury transactions and for the 
global implementation of our Treasury Policy. 
─ On a subsidiary level, where applicable and economically reasonable, local managing directors and 
finance directors are responsible for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries. 
Controlling functions on a corporate level ensure that the transactions of the individual business units 
are in compliance with our Treasury Policy. 
Centralized treasury function 
In accordance with our Treasury Policy, all worldwide credit lines are directly or indirectly managed by the 
Treasury department. Portions of those lines are allocated to our subsidiaries and sometimes backed by 
adidas AG guarantees. As a result of this centralized liquidity management, the company is well positioned 
to allocate resources efficiently throughout the organization. The company’s debt is generally unsecured 
and may include standard covenants, which are reviewed on a quarterly basis. We maintain good relations 
with numerous partner banks, thereby avoiding a high dependency on any single financial institution. 
Banking partners of the company and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB+ long-term 
investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s or an equivalent rating by another leading rating agency. We 
authorize our companies to work with banks with a lower rating only in very exceptional cases. To ensure 
optimal allocation of the company’s liquid financial resources, subsidiaries transfer excess cash to our 
headquarters in all instances where it is legally and economically feasible. In this regard, the 
standardization and consolidation of our global cash management and payment processes, including 
automated domestic and cross-border cash pools is a key priority for our centrally managed Treasury 
department. Effective management of our currency exposure and interest rate risks are additional goals 
and responsibilities of the department. 
► SEE NOTE 02 
Standard covenants 
In the case of our committed credit facilities, we have entered into various legal covenants. These legal 
covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens, cross-
default provisions and change of control. However, our financial arrangements do not contain any financial 
covenants. If we fail to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver, borrowings would become 
due and payable immediately. As at December 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with all our covenants.

We are fully confident we will continue to be compliant with these covenants going forward. We believe 
that cash generated from operating activities, together with access to internal and external sources of 
funds, will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital needs. 
New syndicated credit facility 
In 2020, adidas has taken several steps to considerably strengthen its financial profile. On November 10, 
2020, adidas entered into a new € 1.5 billion syndicated credit facility with 12 of its partner banks. The new 
syndicated credit facility has a maturity in November 2025 with an extension option after year one and year 
two, respectively. This new syndicated credit facility replaced the temporary syndicated loan facility under 
participation of KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank. In April 2020, the company had received 
the approval of the German government for the participation of KfW in the syndicated loan amounting to a 
total of € 3.0 billion to bridge the unprecedented situation caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.  
Bond placements and credit ratings 
On September 1, 2020, adidas successfully placed two bonds amounting to € 1 billion in total. The four-
year bond of € 500 million matures in September 2024 and has a coupon of 0.00%, while the 15-year bond 
of € 500 million matures in September 2035 and has a coupon of 0.625%. The bonds have been listed on 
the Luxemburg Stock Exchange and have denominations of € 100,000 each. 
On September 29, 2020, adidas successfully placed its first sustainability bond as the company continued 
to execute on its ambitious long-term sustainability roadmap while at the same time further optimizing its 
capital structure and financing costs. The € 500 million bond has a term of eight years and a coupon of 
0.00%. It has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and has denominations of € 100,000.  
These transactions followed after adidas had received strong first-time investment-grade ratings by both 
S&P and Moody’s in August. While Standard & Poor’s rated adidas ‘A+,’ Moody’s granted the company an 
‘A2’ rating. The outlook for both ratings is ‘stable.’ The company’s strong credit metrics, robust liquidity 
profile and conservative financial policies are recognized by both agencies. The ratings make adidas one of 
the highest-rated companies both in Germany and in the global sporting goods industry.

Additional credit lines 
In addition to the new syndicated credit facility and improved access to bond markets following the strong 
investment-grade ratings, the company’s financial flexibility is ensured by the availability of further credit 
facilities. At the end of 2020, committed and uncommitted credit lines, including the syndicated loan 
facility, amounted to € 4.274 billion (2019: € 2.105 billion), of which € 4.085 billion was unutilized (2019: 
€ 1.940 billion). Committed and uncommitted credit lines represent approximately 38% and 62% of total 
credit lines, respectively (2019: 46% and 54%, respectively). In addition, we have an unused multi-currency 
commercial paper program in the amount of € 2.0 billion available (2019: € 2.0 billion). We monitor the 
ongoing need for available credit lines based on the current level of debt as well as future financing 
requirements. 
Gross borrowings increase 
The company’s gross borrowings, the vast majority of which are denominated in euro, are composed of 
bank borrowings as well as the outstanding bonds and the equity-neutral convertible bond. Gross 
borrowings increased 93% to € 3.168 billion at the end of 2020 from € 1.638 billion in the prior year. The 
total amount of bonds outstanding at the end of 2020 was € 2.978 billion (2019: € 1.473 billion). Bank

The weighted average interest rate on the company’s gross borrowings decreased to 1.0% in 2020 (2019:

financing represented 98% of total gross borrowings at the end of 2020 (2019: 99%). Variable-rate 
financing accounted for 2% of total gross borrowings at the end of the year (2019: 1%).

Effective foreign exchange management a key priority 
As a globally operating company, adidas is exposed to currency risks. Therefore, effective currency 
management is a key focus of our Treasury department, with the aim of reducing the impact of currency 
fluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cash flows. In this regard, hedging US dollars is a 
central part of our program. This is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing, which is largely 
denominated in US dollars. In 2020, our Treasury department managed a net deficit of around 
US $ 6.1 billion related to operational activities (2019: US $ 7.1 billion). Thereof, around US $ 4.8 billion was 
against the euro (2019: US $ 4.7 billion). As governed by our Treasury Policy, we have established a 
hedging system on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the 
anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In 
rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-month horizon. We had largely covered our 
anticipated hedging needs for 2021 as of the end of 2020. At the same time, we have already started 
hedging our exposure for 2022. The use or combination of different hedging instruments, such as forward 
exchange contracts, currency options and swaps, protects us against unfavorable currency movements.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ADIDAS AG 
adidas AG is the parent company of the adidas Group. It includes operating business functions, primarily 
for the German market, as well as corporate headquarter functions such as Marketing, IT, Treasury, 
Taxes, Legal, and Finance. adidas AG also administers the company’s shareholdings. 
Operating activities and capital structure of adidas AG 
The majority of the operating business of adidas AG consists of the sale of merchandise to wholesale 
partners and own-retail activities. 
In addition to its own trading activities, the results of adidas AG are significantly influenced by its holding 
function for the company as a whole. This is reflected primarily in currency effects, transfer of costs for 
services provided, interest result and income from investments in related companies. 
The opportunities and risks as well as the future development of adidas AG largely reflect those of the 
company as a whole. 
►  SEE OUTLOOK ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
The asset and capital structure of adidas AG is significantly impacted by its holding and financing function 
for the company. For example, 40% of total assets as at December 31, 2020 related to financial assets 
(2019: 44%), which primarily consist of shares in affiliated companies. Intercompany accounts, through 
which transactions between affiliated companies are settled, represent another 21% of total assets (2019: 
32%) and 36% of total equity and liabilities as at December 31, 2020 (2019: 42%). 
Preparation of accounts 
Unlike the consolidated financial statements, which are in conformity with the International Financial

other revenues. In 2020, adidas AG net sales decreased 10% to € 3.991 billion compared to € 4.444 billion 
in the prior year. This decline was mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown measures 
resulting in temporary closures of our own stores as well of our wholesale customers’ stores.  
 
Other operating income up 67% 
In 2020, other operating income of adidas AG increased 67% to € 986 million (2019: € 590 million). This

Other operating expenses increase 10% 
In 2020, other operating expenses for adidas AG rose 10% to € 2.564 billion (2019: € 2.337 billion). This 
was largely attributable to higher currency losses as well as an increase in service costs.

Depreciation and amortization up 6% 
Depreciation and amortization for adidas AG rose 6% to € 127 million in 2020 (2019: € 120 million), mainly 
as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of software. 
Operating result slightly below prior year level 
In 2020, adidas AG generated an operating profit of € 166 million despite the drop in sales (2019: operating 
profit of € 170 million). 
Financial result declines 
The financial result of adidas AG decreased 70% to € 585 million in 2020 (2019: € 1.938 billion). The 
decrease was attributable to lower income from dividends, partly offset by higher profit transfers from 
affiliated companies under profit and loss transfer agreements. 
Net income below prior year level 
Net income, after taxes of € 77 million (2019: € 161 million), amounted to € 674 million in 2020 and was

At the end of December 2020, total assets grew 19% to € 11.959 billion compared to € 10.070 billion in the 
prior year. This development was mainly a result of increases in cash and cash equivalents as well as 
securities, partly offset by the decline in receivables and other assets. 
Shareholders’  equity up 14% 
Shareholders’ equity rose 14% to € 3.533 billion at the end of 2020 (2019: € 3.107 billion). The equity ratio

Provisions decrease 6% 
Provisions were down 6% to € 686 million at the end of 2020 (2019: € 728 million). The decrease primarily 
resulted from lower provisions for personnel. 
Liabilities and other items up 24% 
At the end of December 2020, liabilities and other items increased 24% to € 7.740 billion (2019: € 6.235 
billion) due to newly issued bonds. 
Cash inflow from financing activities reflects change in cash and cash equivalents 
adidas AG has a syndicated credit facility of € 1.5 billion and additional bilateral credit lines of € 1.3 billion. 
In addition, the company has a multi-currency commercial paper program in an amount of € 2.0 billion. 
► SEE TREASURY 
In 2020, operating activities of adidas AG resulted in a cash outflow of € 703 million (2019: € 468 million). 
The change versus the prior year was a result of the decrease in net income, partly offset by lower 
receivables from affiliated companies. Net cash inflow from investment activities was € 160 million (2019: 
€ 1.776 billion). This was primarily attributable to lower dividend income and capital expenditure for 
financial assets. Financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of € 1.162 billion (2019: net cash outflow 
of € 1.546 billion). The net cash inflow from financing activities mainly relates to the issuance of bonds, 
fewer repurchases of adidas AG shares and the fact that no dividends were paid out. As a result of these 
developments, cash and cash equivalents of adidas AG increased to € 1.256 billion at the end of December 
2020 compared to € 636 million at the end of the prior year. 
In 2020, the company changed the allocation of dividends received as well as interest paid and received in 
accordance with the provisions of DRS 21 (Deutsche Rechnungslegungs Standards – German Accounting 
Standards). Comparative information for the 2019 financial year was adjusted. 
adidas AG is able to meet its financial commitments at all times. 
DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO § 315A SECTION 1 AND § 289A 
SECTION 1 OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE AND 
EXPLANATORY REPORT 
Composition of subscribed capital 
The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to € 200,416,186 (as at December 31, 2020) and is divided into 
the same number of registered no-par-value shares with a notional pro rata amount in the nominal capital 
of € 1 each. The nominal capital and the number of shares did not change in the 2020 financial year. The 
shares are fully paid in. Any claim on the part of the shareholders to the issuance of individual share 
certificates is generally excluded pursuant to § 4 section 9 of the Articles of Association unless such 
issuance is required in accordance with the regulations applicable at a stock exchange where the shares 
are admitted. Pursuant to § 67 section 2 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG), in relation 
to adidas AG, only a person who is registered as such in the share register shall be deemed a shareholder. 
Each share grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting and determines the shareholders’ share in the 
company’s profit. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. The shareholders’ individual rights and 
obligations follow from the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular from §§ 12, 53a 
et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 AktG. As at December 31, 2020, adidas AG held 5,350,126 treasury shares in 
total, which do not confer any rights to the company in accordance with § 71b AktG

Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares 
We are not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or other agreements restricting voting 
rights or the transfer of shares. Based on the Code of Conduct and internal guidelines of adidas AG and 
based on Article 19 section 11 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation), however, 
particular trade prohibitions do exist for Executive Board members with regard to the purchase and sale of 
adidas AG shares, in connection with the (time of) publication of half-year or year-end financial reports.  
In addition, restrictions of voting rights may exist pursuant to, inter alia, § 136 AktG or for treasury shares 
pursuant to § 71b AktG as well as due to capital market regulations, in particular pursuant to §§ 33 et seq. 
German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – WpHG). 
The shares that were issued in the context of the Stock Purchase Plan to employees of adidas AG and 
employees of subsidiaries participating in the Stock Purchase Plan are not subject to any lock-up periods, 
unless such a waiting period is stipulated in locally applicable regulations. Employees who hold the shares 
which they purchased themselves (investment shares) for at least one year will subsequently receive one 
share for every six investment shares without having to pay for these shares (matching share) if they are 
still adidas employees at that point in time. If employees transfer, pledge or hypothecate investment 
shares in any way during the one-year vesting period, the right to receive matching shares ceases. 
Shareholdings in share capital exceeding 10% of voting rights 
We have not been notified of, and are not aware of, any direct or indirect shareholdings in the share capital 
of adidas AG reaching or exceeding 10% of the voting rights.
 
Shares with special rights 
There are no shares bearing special rights. In particular, there are no shares with rights conferring 
powers of control.  
Voting right control if employees have a share in the capital 
Like all other shareholders, employees who hold adidas AG shares exercise their control rights directly in 
accordance with statutory provisions and the Articles of Association. The shares which employees acquire 
in the context of the Stock Purchase Plan are held in trust centrally by a service provider on behalf of the 
participating employees. As long as the shares are held in trust, the trustee shall take reasonable 
measures to enable participating employees to directly or indirectly exercise their voting rights in respect 
of the shares held in trust. 
Executive Board appointment and dismissal 
Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of Association and § 84 AktG, the Supervisory Board is responsible for 
determining the exact number of members of the Executive Board, for their appointment and dismissal as 
well as for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The adidas AG Executive Board, which, as 
a basic principle, comprises at least two members, currently consists of the CEO and five further 
members. Executive Board members may be appointed for a maximum period of five years. Such 
appointments may be renewed and the terms of office may be extended, provided that no term exceeds 
five years. 
► SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD 
The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Executive Board or 
CEO if there is good cause, such as gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual 
General Meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – 
MitbestG), the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal require a majority of at 
least two thirds of the Supervisory Board members (§ 31 MitbestG). If such a majority is not established in 
the first vote by the Supervisory Board, the Mediation Committee has to present a proposal which, however, 
does not exclude other proposals. The appointment or dismissal is then made in a second vote with a simple 
majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board members. Should the required majority not be 
established in this case either, a third vote, again requiring a simple majority, must be held in which the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board has two votes. 
If the Executive Board does not have the required number of members, the competent court must, in urgent 
cases, make the necessary appointment upon application (§ 85 section 1 AktG). 
Amendments to the articles of association 
Pursuant to §§ 119 section 1 number 5, 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG, the Articles of Association of adidas 
AG can, in principle, only be amended by a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting. Pursuant to 
§ 21 section 3 of the Articles of Association in conjunction with § 179 section 2 sentence 2 AktG, the Annual 
General Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves upon amendments to the Articles of Association with a 
simple majority of the votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal capital represented when 
passing the resolution. If mandatory legal provisions stipulate a larger majority of voting rights or capital, 
this is applicable. When it comes to amendments solely relating to the wording, the Supervisory Board 
is authorized to make these modifications in accordance with § 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in 
conjunction with § 10 section 1 sentence 2 of the Articles of Association.  
Authorizations of the Executive Board 
The authorizations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§ 76 et seq. AktG in conjunction with §§ 7 
and 8 of the Articles of Association. The Executive Board is responsible, in particular, for managing the 
company and represents the company judicially and extra-judicially. 
Authorization of the Executive Board to issue shares 
The authorization of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated by § 4 of the Articles of Association 
and by statutory provisions: 
Authorized Capital 
─ Until June 14, 2021, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to 
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times 
by no more than € 4,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2016). Any repurchased treasury shares of 
the company which are used by the company for employee stock purchase plans during the term of 
this authorization shall be attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. Shareholders’ 
subscription rights shall be excluded. The new shares may only be issued to (current and former) 
employees of the company and its affiliated companies as well as to (current and former) members of 
management bodies of the company’s affiliated companies (‘eligible persons’). 
─ Until June 7, 2022, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to 
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times 
by no more than € 50,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2017/I). The Executive Board may, subject 
to Supervisory Board approval, exclude residual amounts from shareholders’ subscription rights. 
─ Until June 7, 2022, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to 
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times 
by no more than € 20,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2017/III). The Executive Board may, 
subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude residual amounts from shareholders’ subscription

rights. Additionally, the Executive Board may, subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude 
shareholders’ subscription rights when issuing the new shares at a price not significantly below the 
stock market price of the company’s shares already quoted on the stock exchange at the point in time 
when the issue price is ultimately determined, which should be as close as possible to the placement 
of the shares; this exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated with the listing of the 
company’s shares on a foreign stock exchange. The authorization to exclude subscription rights 
pursuant to the previous sentence may, however, only be used to the extent that the pro rata amount of 
the new shares in the nominal capital together with the pro rata amount in the nominal capital of other 
shares which have been issued by adidas AG since May 11, 2017, subject to the exclusion of 
subscription rights pursuant to or in accordance with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG on the basis of 
an authorized capital or following a repurchase, or for which subscription or conversion rights or 
subscription or conversion obligations have been granted since May 11, 2017, through the issuance of 
convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, with subscription rights excluded pursuant to § 186 
section 3 sentence 4 AktG, does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing on the date of the entry 
of this authorization into the commercial register or – if this amount is lower – on the respective date 
on which the resolution on utilization of the authorization is adopted. The overall volume of the shares 
issued based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights – together with shares 
issued against contributions in kind with the exclusion of subscription rights from the Authorized 
Capital 2017/II – must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the date of the respective 
issuance. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from 
subscription rights. 
─ Until June 13, 2024, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to 
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in kind once or several times 
by no more than € 16,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2019). The Executive Board may, subject 
to Supervisory Board approval, exclude shareholders’ subscription rights. The overall volume of the 
shares issued with the exclusion of subscription rights based on this authorization must not exceed 
10% of the nominal capital existing at the point in time when this authorization becomes effective or, in 
case this amount is lower, at the date of the respective issuance. The nominal capital which is 
attributed to the shares to be issued to service option or conversion rights or option or conversion 
obligations from bonds, debt securities or participation rights to the extent that they are issued during 
the term of the authorization until the date of the respective exercise of this authorization with the 
exclusion of subscription rights, or which is attributed to shares which are issued or sold during the 
term of the authorization until the date of the respective exercise of this authorization with the 
exclusion of subscription rights, has to be included in the aforementioned limit of 10%. This deduction 
clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from subscription rights. The 
Authorized Capital 2019 must not be used to issue shares within the scope of compensation or 
participation programs for Executive Board members or employees or for members of the 
management bodies or employees of subsidiaries. 
► SEE NOTE 27 
Contingent Capital 
The nominal capital of the company is conditionally increased by up to € 12,500,000 (Contingent Capital 
2018). The Contingent Capital serves the purpose of granting holders or creditors of bonds that were 
issued based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018 subscription or conversion 
rights relating to no more than a total of 12,500,000 shares in compliance with the corresponding 
conditions of the bonds. Based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018, 
the Executive Board is authorized to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds in an aggregate 
nominal value of up to € 2,500,000,000 with or without a limited term against contributions in cash once or 
several times until May 8, 2023, and to guarantee bonds issued by subordinated Group companies. The 
Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders’ 
subscription rights for residual amounts and to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights insofar as this is

necessary for granting subscription rights to which holders or creditors of previously issued bonds are 
entitled. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude 
shareholders’ subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical 
market value of these bonds and the number of shares to be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal 
capital. Treasury shares which are or will be sold with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance 
with § 71 section 1 no. 8 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between the starting date of 
the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds shall be attributed to the 
aforementioned limit of 10%. Shares which are or will be issued, subject to the exclusion of subscription 
rights pursuant to § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG or pursuant to § 203 section 1 in conjunction with § 186 
section 3 sentence 4 AktG between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of 
the respective bonds in the context of a cash capital increase shall also be attributed to the 
aforementioned limit of 10%. Finally, shares for which there are option or conversion rights or obligations 
or a right to delivery of shares of the company in favor of the company due to bonds with warrants or 
convertible bonds issued by the company or its subordinated Group companies, subject to the exclusion of 
subscription rights in accordance with § 221 section 4 sentence 2 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 
sentence 4 AktG during the term of this authorization based on other authorizations shall be attributed to 
the aforementioned limit of 10%. Notwithstanding the Supervisory Board’s right to determine further 
approval requirements, the Executive Board requires the Supervisory Board’s approval for the issuance of 
bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds based on this authorization of the Annual General Meeting 
on May 9, 2018 with the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights. 
The Executive Board has so far not utilized the authorization to issue bonds with warrants and/or 
convertible bonds granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018. 
Authorization of the Executive Board to repurchase shares 
The authorizations of the Executive Board to repurchase adidas AG shares arise from §§ 71 et seq. AktG 
and, as at the balance sheet date, from the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 
May 12, 2016. 
Until May 11, 2021, the Executive Board is authorized to repurchase adidas AG shares amounting to a total 
of 10% of the nominal capital at the date of the resolution (or, as the case may be, a lower amount of 
nominal capital at the date of utilization of the authorization) for any lawful purpose and within the legal 
framework. The authorization may be used by the company but also by its subordinated Group companies 
or by third parties on account of the company or its subordinated Group companies or third parties 
assigned by the company or one of its subordinated Group companies. 
The repurchase can be carried out via the stock exchange, through a public invitation to submit sale offers, 
through a public repurchase offer, or through granting tender rights to shareholders. The authorization 
furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case.  
The purposes for which treasury shares repurchased based on this authorization may be used are set out 
in the resolution on Item 9 of the Agenda for the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016. The shares 
may in particular be used as follows: 
─ They may be sold on the stock exchange or through a public offer to all shareholders in relation to their 
shareholding quota; in case of an offer to all shareholders, subscription rights for residual amounts 
are excluded. The shares may also be sold differently, provided the shares are sold in exchange for a 
cash payment and at a price that, at the time of the sale, is not significantly below the stock market 
price of the company’s shares with the same features; the prorated amount of the nominal capital 
which is attributable to the aggregate number of shares sold under this authorization may not exceed 
10% of the nominal capital. The prorated amount of the nominal capital attributable to new shares

issued between May 12, 2016 and the sale of the shares based on an authorized capital with the 
exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights pursuant to § 203 section 1 in conjunction with § 186 
section 3 sentence 4 AktG shall be attributed to the limit of 10%. Likewise, the prorated amount of the 
nominal capital that is attributable to shares which may be issued due to bonds with warrants and/or 
convertible bonds which are linked to subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the company’s 
right to delivery of shares, provided these bonds are issued on the basis of authorizations pursuant to 
§§ 221 section 4, 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between May 12, 2016 and the sale of the shares, shall 
also be attributed to the limit of 10%. 
─ They may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or indirect acquisition of companies, 
parts of companies, participations in companies or other economic assets or within the scope of 
company mergers. 
─ They may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition of industrial property rights or intangible 
property rights or for the acquisition of licenses relating to such rights, also through subordinated Group 
companies. 
─ They may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the 
company’s right to delivery of shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds 
issued by the company or its subordinated Group companies. 
─ In connection with employee stock purchase plans, up to 4,000,000 shares may be issued in favor of 
(current and former) employees of the company and its affiliated companies as well as in favor of 
(current and former) management bodies of the company’s affiliated companies. The number of shares 
the company issues to eligible persons by partially utilizing the Authorized Capital 2016 shall be 
attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. 
─ They may be canceled without such cancelation requiring an additional resolution of the Annual General 
Meeting. 
Furthermore, the shares may be promised or assigned to members of the Executive Board as 
compensation by way of a stock bonus subject to the provision that resale by the Executive Board 
members shall only be permitted following a retention period of at least three years from the date of 
assignment. Responsibility in this case lies with the Supervisory Board. 
In case of utilization of shares for the aforementioned purposes, except for the cancelation of shares, 
shareholders’ subscription rights are excluded. 
The Supervisory Board may determine that transactions based on this authorization may only be carried 
out subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees. 
In the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, the Executive Board partly utilized the authorization to 
repurchase adidas AG shares through the share buyback program 2018 – 2021. In the financial year 2018, 
in a first tranche, adidas AG bought back 5,089,879 adidas AG shares. In the financial year 2019, in a 
second tranche, 3,223,214 adidas AG shares were repurchased. In a third tranche, adidas bought back 
another 953,018 adidas shares in the year under review. In each case, the share buyback took place via the 
stock exchange. 
► SEE NOTE 27 
In the scope of the authorization resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016, the 
Executive Board is furthermore authorized to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives 
which are arranged with a credit institution or financial services institution in close conformity with market

conditions. adidas AG may acquire call options issued for physical delivery and/or sell put options or use a 
combination of call and put options or other equity derivatives if the option conditions ensure that the 
shares delivered for these equity derivatives were purchased in compliance with the principle of equal 
treatment. All share purchases using the aforementioned equity derivatives are limited to a maximum 
value of 5% of the nominal capital existing at the date on which the resolution was adopted by the Annual 
General Meeting (or, as the case may be, a lower amount of nominal capital at the date of utilization of the 
authorization). The term of the options may not exceed 18 months and must furthermore be chosen in 
such a way that the shares are acquired upon the exercise of the options no later than May 11, 2021. The 
authorization furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each 
case. 
For excluding subscription rights, the use and cancelation of shares purchased using equity derivatives, 
the general provisions adopted by the Annual General Meeting (set out above) are applicable accordingly. 
Change of control/compensation agreements 
Substantial agreements that provide for regulations in the case of a change of control are the material 
financing agreements of adidas AG. In the case of a change of control, these agreements, as is customary 
in the market, entitle the creditor/bondholder to termination and early calling-in. 
No compensation agreements were entered into with members of the Executive Board or employees 
relating to the event of a takeover bid.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT 
adidas has divided its operating activities into the following operating segments: Europe, North America 
adidas, North America Reebok, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America, Emerging Markets, adidas Golf, 
Runtastic and Other centrally managed businesses. While the operating segments Europe, Asia-Pacific, 
Russia/CIS, Latin America, and Emerging Markets are reported separately, North America adidas and 
North America Reebok are combined to the reportable segment North America. Each reportable 
segment comprises all wholesale, retail and e-commerce business activities relating to the distribution 
and sale of products of the adidas and Reebok brands to retail customers and end consumers. The 
remaining operating segments are aggregated under Other Businesses due to their relatively lesser 
significance. 
All markets significantly impacted by global coronavirus pandemic 
The global spread of the coronavirus during 2020 led to a significant number of temporary store closures, 
with a corresponding negative impact on adidas’ top-line development in all market segments. Exceptional 
e-commerce growth could only partially offset the material revenue decline in the physical channels. In 
most segments, a more favorable channel mix due to the exceptional e-commerce growth had a positive 
effect on the gross margin development. However, this was more than offset by a less favorable pricing 
mix due to increased promotional activity and negative currency fluctuations in most segments. At the 
same time, operating expenses declined in all segments as a result of the company’s decision to 
proactively reduce costs in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

margin was down 5.4 percentage points to 17.8% (2019: 23.2%). Operating profit in Europe declined 33% to 
€ 947 million versus € 1.408 billion in the prior year.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
OUTLOOK 
In 2021, we expect a robust recovery of the global economy and consumer spending. While uncertainty 
due to prolonged adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic remains high, we anticipate the global 
sporting goods industry to recover notably in 2021. Besides structural industry tailwinds, the execution 
of our new strategy ‘Own the Game’ as well as our strong product pipeline are forecast to lead to 
currency-neutral net sales growth in a mid-to high-teens range. Gross margin is expected to almost 
fully recover to the pre-covid-19 level and to reach around 52%. Operating margin is anticipated to 
increase to a level of between 9% and 10%. As a result, net income from continuing operations is 
forecast to increase to a level of between € 1.25 billion and € 1.45 billion. All expectations stated in this 
outlook exclude contributions from the Reebok brand. 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
Intended divestiture of Reebok 
As part of the development of its new strategy ‘Own the Game’, adidas has concluded its assessment of 
strategic alternatives for Reebok. As a result of this review, the company decided in February 2021 to 
begin a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok. Accordingly, adidas is going to report the Reebok 
business as discontinued operations from the first quarter 2021 onward. Immediately before the 
reclassification to discontinued operations, an impairment test according to IAS 36 was conducted and no 
impairment or write-up was required. On the initial classification as discontinued operations, the 
measurement at fair value also did not lead to an impairment. The table further below in this chapter 
shows the major line items in the consolidated income statement for the year 2020 under the assumption 
that the Reebok business activities had been represented as discontinued operations on January 1, 2020. 
OUTLOOK 
Forward-looking statements 
This Management Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect Management’s current view 
with respect to the future development of our company. The outlook is based on estimates that we have 
made on the basis of all the information available to us at the time of completion of this Annual Report. In 
addition, such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties which are beyond the control of the 
company. In case the underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or described risks or opportunities 
materialize, actual results and developments may materially deviate (negatively or positively) from those 
expressed by such statements. adidas does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking 
statements made in this Management Report beyond statutory disclosure obligations.

Changes to segmental reporting 
At the beginning of 2021, we launched our new strategy ‘Own the Game’ for the period until 2025. As part 
of this strategy, we focus our growth efforts on the three strategic markets Greater China, North America 
and EMEA. In these markets, we will bring exciting consumer experiences to life by pursuing a tailored 
approach that appeals to local trends. In order to be able to execute this strategy successfully, adidas has 
changed its organizational structure. Since January 1, 2021, adidas manages Greater China as a separate 
market. The remaining Asia-Pacific (APAC) market now comprises Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia 
and the Pacific region. The change reflects the increasing importance of Greater China as a growth market 
for the company. In addition, adidas created the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) market. To better 
leverage economies of scale, the company has integrated the former markets Europe, Russia/CIS and 
Emerging Markets into the newly formed EMEA market. The markets North America and Latin America 
remain unchanged. 
Global economic growth to recover in 2021
18
 
Global GDP is expected to grow 4.0% in 2021, while uncertainty due to prolonged adverse effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic remains high. Output, consumption, and trade are forecast to gradually improve 
amid effective pandemic management as well as continued monetary policy accommodation. 
Nevertheless, delays in the development and issuance of vaccines and extended lockdown measures 
remain existing downside risks to the economic recovery. In addition, differences in the pace of growth 
between developed and developing economies affect the global GDP projection. Developed economies are 
forecast to see an increase of growth to 3.3%, underlined by widespread vaccination as well as consumer 
confidence, consumption and trade gradually improving. Growth in developing economies is projected at 
5.0%, reflecting a rebound in industrial production, retail sales and trade. On a global level, additional 
downside risks include a re-escalation of trade tensions and lengthy setbacks in containing the pandemic. 
Sporting goods industry to recover notably in 2021 
In the absence of any delay in the pandemic recovery or other macroeconomic shocks, we expect the 
global sporting goods industry to recover notably in 2021. Consumer confidence is forecast to rebound 
amid widespread vaccination and effective pandemic management as well as major sports events 
returning to the global stage. While extended lockdown periods, quarantine measures and physical store 
closures are still forecast to have an adverse impact in the short term, the sporting goods industry is 
projected to remain fundamentally attractive in the long term, as existing global trends are accelerating. 
Sports-inspired apparel and footwear (‘athleisure’) keeps evolving as a structural component of the 
broader fashion landscape, complemented by increasing sports participation rates as well as rising 
awareness for health and wellness. In addition, sustainability is expected to further gain in importance 
amid growing environmental awareness of consumers. Moreover, purchasing behavior is forecast to 
further shift toward online and social channels, and consumer insights generation along with the creation 
of premium shopping experiences become increasingly important. For the sporting goods sector too, risks 
related to re-escalating trade tensions and a delay in the pandemic recovery, remain.

Currency-neutral sales to increase in the mid- to high-teens in 2021 
After the significant revenue decline experienced in 2020 due to the global outbreak of the coronavirus, we 
expect a strong recovery in terms of currency-neutral sales in 2021. Despite continued lockdown 
measures in certain parts of the world and uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook, the 
company’s sales development will be favorably impacted by long-term industry growth drivers such as 
increasing sports participation, the growing penetration of sports-inspired apparel and footwear 
(‘athleisure’) and digitalization. Beyond these structural industry tailwinds, the execution of our new 
strategy ‘Own the Game’ as well as our strong product pipeline are expected to drive strong sales growth. 
Specifically, we expect sales to increase at a mid- to high-teens rate on a currency-neutral basis. Similar 
to 2020, currency headwinds are forecast to persist, resulting in lower sales growth in reported terms. 
Currency-neutral revenues to increase in all market segments  
In 2021, we expect currency-neutral revenues to increase in all market segments. The markets that were 
impacted the most in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic are anticipated to also show the strongest 
recovery in 2021. Consequently, Greater China, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are all projected to grow 
currency-neutral net sales in a range of between 20% and 30%. EMEA is expected to record growth in the 
mid- to high-teens. And North America, the market that was least impacted in 2020, is forecast to expand 
currency-neutral revenues at a high-single-digit rate. 
Gross margin expected to recover almost fully to around 52% 
The gross margin was also negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In 2021, gross 
margin is expected to almost fully recover to the pre-covid-19 level and to reach a level of around 52%. 
Unfavorable currency developments will continue to weigh on gross margin development, especially in the 
first half of the year. These will be more than compensated in particular by an improved pricing mix, as 
discount levels normalize.

Operating margin to expand to a level of between 9% and 10% 
In 2021, the operating margin is projected to increase significantly to a level of between 9% and 10%. After 
deleverage in 2020, the significant recovery in net sales is expected to lead the margin recovery. Additional 
support will come from the improvement in gross margin and continued strict cost control. Net income 
from continuing operations is projected to increase to a level of between € 1.25 billion and € 1.45 billion. 
Average operating working capital as a percentage of sales to decrease  
During the coronavirus pandemic, average operating working capital as a percentage of sales increased as 
a result of prolonged temporary store closures and reduced sell-through. Already toward the end of 2020, 
we were able to normalize inventory levels. In 2021, we will continue this development and bring average 
operating working capital as percentage of sales back to below 20%. 
Capital expenditure to increase to around € 700 million 
In order to execute our growth strategy, we will continue to invest into our business. Consequently, capital 
expenditure is expected to increase to a level of around € 700 million in 2021. Investments into our own-
retail stores as well as into digital, including e-commerce, will make up the biggest part of capital 
expenditure. 
Management proposes to resume dividend payments 
The adidas Executive Board decided to resume the company’s dividend payments. Subject to the approval 
by the Supervisory Board, the company will propose paying a dividend of € 3.00 per dividend-entitled share 
for the financial year 2020 to adidas shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2021. The 
dividend proposal, which reflects the company’s strengthened financial profile as well as Management’s 
positive outlook for the current year, would result in a total dividend payout of € 585 million.

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
In order to remain competitive and ensure sustainable success, adidas consciously takes risks and 
continuously explores and develops opportunities. Our risk and opportunity management principles and 
system provide the framework for our company to conduct business in a well-controlled environment. 
Risk and opportunity management principles 
The key objective of the risk and opportunity management is to support business success and protect the 
company as a going concern through an opportunity-focused but risk-aware decision-making framework. 
Our Risk Management Policy outlines the principles, processes, tools, risk areas, key responsibilities, 
reporting requirements and communication timelines within our company. Risk and opportunity 
management is a company-  wide activity which utilizes key insights from the members of the Executive 
Board as well as from global and local business units and functions. We define risk as the potential 
occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to 
achieve the company’s business objectives or financial goals. Opportunity is defined as the potential 
occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that can positively impact the company’s 
ability to achieve its business objectives or financial goals. 
Risk and opportunity management system 
The Executive Board has overall responsibility for establishing a risk and opportunity management system 
that ensures comprehensive and consistent management of all material risks and opportunities. The Risk 
Management department governs, operates, and develops the company’s risk and opportunity 
management system and is the owner of the centrally managed risk and opportunity management process 
on behalf of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of 
the risk management system. These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. 
Working independently of all other functions of the organizations, the Internal Audit department provides 
objective assurance to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee regarding the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the company’s risk and opportunity management system on a regular basis. In addition, 
the Internal Audit department includes an assessment of the effectiveness of risk management processes 
and compliance with the company’s Risk Management Policy as part of its regular auditing activities with 
selected adidas subsidiaries or functions each year. 
Our risk and opportunity management system is based on frameworks for enterprise risk management 
and internal controls developed and published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of 
the Treadway Commission. Additionally, we have adapted our risk and opportunity management system to 
more appropriately reflect the structure as well as the culture of the company. This system focuses on the 
identification, evaluation, handling, systematic reporting and monitoring of risks and opportunities.

Our risk and opportunity management process comprises the following steps: 
─ Risk and opportunity identification: adidas continuously monitors the macroeconomic environment

opportunities as early as possible. On a semi-annual basis, the Risk Management department 
conducts a survey with all members of the Core Leadership Group (CLG), Extended Leadership Group

and opportunities. Risk Management has also defined 25 categories to help identify risks and 
opportunities in a systematic way. In addition, adidas uses various instruments in the risk and 
opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including 
trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners and controlled 
space network. These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. 
Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups and 
product styles which show most potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our 
analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or 
changing consumer tastes. Furthermore, as part of our identification process, we monitor physical 
risks related to climate change as well as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. Our risk and opportunity identification process is however not only limited to 
external risk factors or opportunities, it also includes an internal perspective that considers company 
culture, processes, projects, human resources and compliance aspects. 
─ Risk and opportunity evaluation: we assess identified risks and opportunities individually according to 
a systematic evaluation methodology, which allows adequate prioritization as well as allocation of 
resources. Risk and opportunity evaluation is part of the responsibility of the Risk Management 
department supported by subject matter experts as well as internal and external data. The Risk 
Management department also conducts workshops with the Executive Board members and senior 
leaders to validate the evaluation of risks and opportunities. 
According to our methodology, risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two dimensions: the 
potential impact and the likelihood that this impact materializes. Based on this evaluation, we classify 
risks and opportunities into three categories: minor, moderate, and major.  
The potential impact is evaluated using five categories: marginal, low, medium, high, and significant. 
These categories represent financial or equivalent non-financial measurements. The financial 
measurements are based on the potential effect on the company’s net income. Non-financial 
measurements used are the degree to which the company’s reputation, brand image and employer 
value proposition are affected. Moreover, the degree of damage to people’s health and safety and the 
degree of legal and judicial consequences at the corporate and personal level can be considered. 
Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or opportunity may materialize with the specific 
impact. The likelihood of individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale divided 
into five categories.

1 Based on net income. 
When evaluating risks and opportunities, we also consider the speed of materialization (velocity). In 
this respect, we differentiate between risks and opportunities that could materialize within six months, 
within a time period of six to twelve months and after twelve months.  
We consider both the gross and the net risk in our risk assessments. While the gross risk reflects the 
inherent risk before any mitigating action, the net risk reflects the residual risk after all mitigating 
action. On the one hand, this approach allows for a good understanding of the impact of mitigating 
action taken; on the other hand, it provides the basis for scenario analysis. Our assessment of risks 
presented in this report only reflects the net risk perspective. We measure the actual financial impact

of the most relevant risks and opportunities that materialized against the original assessment on a 
yearly basis (‘back-testing’). In this way, we ensure continuous monitoring of the accuracy of risk and 
opportunity evaluations across the company, which enables us to continuously improve evaluation 
methodology based on our findings.  
In assessing the potential effect from opportunities, each opportunity is appraised with respect to 
viability, commerciality and potential risks. This approach is applied to longer-term strategic prospects 
but also to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at the corporate level as well as at the 
market and brand level. In contrast to the risk evaluation, only the net perspective exists for assessing 
opportunities. 
─ Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated in accordance with the company’s 
risk and opportunity management principles as described in the Risk Management Policy. Risk Owners 
are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate risk-mitigating action within their area of 
responsibility. In addition, the Risk Owners need to determine a general risk-handling strategy for the 
identified risks, which is either risk avoidance, risk reduction with the objective to lower impact and/or 
likelihood, risk transfer to a third party or risk acceptance. The decision on the implementation of the 
respective risk-handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the benefit of any 
planned mitigating action if applicable. The Risk Management department works closely with the Risk 
Owners to monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating action and assess the viability of 
already implemented mitigating action. Depending on the risk class determined by the risk and 
opportunity evaluation, the authority to make decisions to accept risks resides with the Executive 
Board, leaders reporting directly to an Executive Board member and the operational management on 
the next hierarchical level. The decision to accept material risks without taking additional mitigating 
action can only be made by the entire Executive Board. 
─ Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our risk and opportunity management system aims to 
increase the transparency of risks and opportunities. As both risks and opportunities are subject to 
constant change, Risk Owners not only monitor developments but also the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the current risk-handling strategy on an ongoing basis. 
Regular risk reporting takes place half-yearly and consists of a five-step reporting stream: 
─ Risk Management identifies risks and opportunities (with a potential effect on net income higher than 
€ 1 million) by conducting a survey of CLG, ELG and GHIPO members as well as utilizing available 
information concerning the internal and external environment of the company. Risk Management 
evaluates, consolidates and aggregates the identified risks and opportunities (‘bottom-up 
assessment’).   
─ Risk Management discusses the assessment of substantial risks and opportunities with the members 
of the Executive Board and leaders directly reporting to them. The Executive Board members and their 
direct reports validate the assessment of risks and opportunities in their respective area of 
responsibility (‘top-down assessment’).  
─ Risk Management provides a consolidated report to the Executive Board summarizing the results of 
both bottom-up and top-down assessment. The Executive Board reviews the report, jointly agrees on a 
final company assessment of risks and opportunities, and decides if Risk Owners are required to take 
further action. 
─ Based on the Executive Board’s decision, Risk Management creates the final risk and opportunity 
report that is also shared with the CLG.

Compliance management system (adidas Fair Play Compliance Framework) 
⌐ We consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative. 
The Executive Board sets the tone right from the top – every employee is required to act ethically and in 
compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations while executing the company’s 
business. We believe our Compliance Management System will prevent the majority of potential 
compliance issues. For that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns. We 
realize, however, that no compliance system can eliminate all violations.  
The adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company’s Fair Play Compliance Framework. We see 
compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain. Our 
central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance 
Officers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the 
central Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.  
The company’s Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate 
Governance. It refers to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and is designed to: 
─ support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth through good corporate governance; 
─ reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by non-compliant conduct; 
─ protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the company and its brand through compliant 
conduct; and 
─ preserve diversity by fighting harassment and discrimination. 
The adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee 
behavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas. In 2020, we revised the Code of 
Conduct to ensure it remains up to date and reflects our business environment

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
The Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and respond. 
─ Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates our Compliance Management System 
as necessary. In addition to the revised Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also introduced an Anti-
Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy in September 2020, emphasizing adidas’ renewed initiative 
to prevent and fight harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Management also shares 
compliance-related communication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to 
all employees globally during onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. The Compliance team and 
partners also provide targeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management 
and newly promoted or hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the 
compliance ‘tone from the top’, as well as the ‘tone from the middle’. We closely monitor the 
completion rates for these training measures and continuously update our web-based training. In 
2020, the company launched trainings on several topics, including information security, procurement, 
and diversity & inclusion. We also focused on strengthening cooperation between the Compliance team 
and the Internal Audit, the Group Policies & Internal Controls, and the Risk Management departments.  
─ Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential 
infringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report compliance 
concerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers 
or Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or the Works Council. Employees can also 
report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website which also allow for 
anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times worldwide, 
including the services of interpreters, if required. It is promoted digitally and with posters to reach all 
our locations around the world. The company’s continuous work to identify potential compliance 
violations has accelerated in 2020 through several initiatives related to the Global Diversity & Inclusion 
Program. Among others, we reemphasized our Fair Play hotline in retail, warehouses, and corporate 
offices worldwide. 
─ Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief 
Compliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional 
Compliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and 
report potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2020, we recorded 414 potential compliance 
violations (2019: 514). Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are 
used to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance 
violations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of 
employment contracts. Furthermore, in 2020 the Compliance team strengthened its relationship with 
the HR organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, including those related to harassment 
and discrimination.

Description of the main features of the internal control and risk management system process 
pursuant to § 315 section 4 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) 
The internal control and risk management system relating to the consolidated financial reporting process 
of the company represents a process embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It 
aims to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the company’s external financial 
reporting by ensuring company-wide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies 
(Finance Manual). We regard the internal control and risk management system as a process based on the 
principle of segregation of duties, encompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, 
Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning, Reporting and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, 
mitigation, monitoring and reporting of financial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are 
assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a first step, the internal control and risk management system 
serves to identify, assess, limit and control risks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process 
which might result in the consolidated financial statements not being compliant with internal and external 
regulations.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the 
effectiveness of ICoFR, the Group Policies & Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit 
department regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the 
external auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR. However, due to the 
limitations of ICoFR, even with appropriate and functional systems absolute certainty about the 
effectiveness of ICoFR cannot be guaranteed. 
All adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance 
Manual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the 
company-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory 
changes and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all 
adidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees’ scope of discretion with regard to recognition 
and valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within 
the company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the 
four-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the 
accounting process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director confirm 
adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting 
department semi-annually. 
The accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services. 
Virtually all of the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide 
standardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company, 
the local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS. 
At the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas 
companies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated 
validations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and 
adherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial 
data as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of 
independent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-routine basis. 
After ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins, 
running automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those 
relating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-
based, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by 
systematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas 
companies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and 
in the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances. 
Unless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material 
deviations. 
All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization 
concepts, approval concepts and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular 
basis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is 
minimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of 
change processes and regular data backups.

Risks related to the coronavirus pandemic 
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic could substantially impact the company’s success in multiple ways, in 
particular in the short term. Risks related to the coronavirus pandemic include, but are not limited to: 
─ Wide-spread lockdowns and containment measures across all our markets might result in traffic 
declines in our own and our retail partners’ stores or even require those stores to close. This could 
have a noticeable negative impact on the company’s financial performance as seen in 2020.  
─ Closures of distribution centers would negatively impact the company’s ability to fulfill orders by 
consumers or retail partners and as a result lead to sales and profit shortfalls, order cancellations or 
excess inventory.  
─ Supply chain disruptions such as the closure of factories of our manufacturing partners or the closure 
of ports in critical sourcing countries could cause production or delivery delays and consequently 
negatively impact our ability to fulfill consumer demand.  
─ Major sports events such the Olympic Games in Tokyo or the UEFA Euro 2021 could take place without 
people in attendance or even be canceled completely. This would result in sales and profit shortfalls 
and more importantly negatively affect our ability to showcase our brand and new product innovations.  
─ Wholesale customers may cancel purchase orders or return product to adidas which could result in 
excess inventory and higher inventory allowances.  
─ Lower than expected sales and profits in our own retail stores may result in higher impairment 
charges or inventory allowances and negatively affect the company’s bottom line.

─ Third-party business partners may partially or completely fail to meet their contractual financial 
obligations, which could result in higher loss allowances and increased write-offs for accounts 
receivable.  
─ A global recession or substantial economic downturns in key markets could lead to rising 
unemployment, declining disposable incomes and consumer confidence, which could harm the 
company’s financial and business performance.  
─ Volatile global financial markets might negatively affect the company’s access to capital in the future. 
─ Office locations may temporarily be closed or operate with substantially reduced capacity which could 
interrupt employee efficiency and productivity and therefore have negative effects on business 
performance. 
To mitigate the effects of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, adidas is taking numerous measures. We are 
further shifting our focus to our own and our partners’ e-commerce and other digital channels with 
targeted consumer marketing, exclusive product launches and prioritized supply chain management. 
Through strict cash flow and cost management we ensure the financial stability of our company. In 2020, 
the company obtained investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s and strengthened its 
liquidity and financial flexibility. With flexible shifts in our product purchasing in close alignment with our 
manufacturing partners, a disciplined sell-in and the conscious use of our factory outlets, we reduce 
negative margin effects and avoid excess inventory. Through strict measures, adidas is safeguarding the 
health of its employees and other stakeholders. For example, we have increased our workplace flexibility 
and given our employees the possibility to work remotely, depending on the development of infection rates 
in the respective countries
.  
Macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory, and currency risks 
Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on consumer spending and consumer 
confidence. Economic downturns, financial market turbulence, currency exchange rate fluctuations and 
sociopolitical factors such as military conflicts, changes of government, civil unrest, pandemics, 
nationalization, or expropriation, in particular in regions where adidas is strongly represented, therefore 
could negatively impact the company’s business activities and top- and bottom-line performance. A slow 
recovery of travel activity could negatively affect business in tourist destinations and lead to sales 
shortfalls, higher inventory in the marketplace, increased clearance activity, and margin pressure.  
Currency risks are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the company, in particular the 
mismatch of the currencies required for sourcing our products versus the denominations of our sales. 
Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the 
company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on our company’s 
financial performance. In addition, substantial changes in the regulatory environment (e.g. trade 
restrictions, economic and political sanctions, regulations concerning product compliance, environmental, 
and climate protection regulations) could lead to potential sales shortfalls or cost increases
. ► SEE NOTE 30 
To mitigate these macroeconomic, sociopolitical, and regulatory risks, adidas strives to balance sales 
across key regions and also between developed and emerging markets. We continuously monitor the 
macroeconomic, political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem 
areas, so that we can quickly adjust our business activities accordingly upon any change in conditions. 
Potential adjustments may be a reallocation of manufacturing of our products to alternative countries, a 
reallocation of investments to alternative, more attractive markets, changes in product prices, closure of 
our own-retail stores, more conservative product purchasing, tight working capital management and an 
increased focus on cost control.

To mitigate the risk related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we utilize a centralized currency 
risk management system and hedge currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling 
basis up to 24 months in advance. In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-months horizon. 
► SEE TREASURY 
By building on our leading position within the sporting goods industry, we actively engage in supporting 
policymakers and regulators in their efforts to liberalize global trade and curtail trade barriers, and to 
proactively adapt to significant changes in the regulatory environment. 
Risks related to consumer demand and product offering 
Our success largely depends on our ability to continuously create new, innovative, and sustainable 
products. Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpected, particularly when it comes to the 
more fashion-related part of our business Therefore, we face a risk of short-term revenue loss in cases 
where we are unable to anticipate consumer demand or respond quickly to changes. In addition, creating 
and offering products that do not resonate with consumers and our retail partners is a critical risk to the 
success of our brands, especially considering our focus on key product franchises. This risk could be 
exacerbated if our marketing activities and brand campaigns fail to generate consumer excitement. We 
consider this risk most relevant in our key markets Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Even more 
critical in the long term, however, are the risks of continuously overlooking new trends and failing to 
continuously introduce and successfully commercialize new product innovation. 
To mitigate these risks, identifying and responding to shifts in consumer demand as early as possible is a 
key responsibility of our brand and sales organizations and, in particular, of the respective Risk Owners. 
Therefore, we utilize extensive primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and 
opportunity identification process. By putting the consumer at the center of our decision-making, we 
intend to create higher brand advocacy and to attract new consumers. We continuously expand our 
consumer analytics efforts to read and quickly react to changes in demand or trend shifts. In addition, 
direct touchpoints with consumers via our own digital channels and direct communication with consumers 
on social media platforms strengthen our understanding of consumer preferences and behavior, and, as a 
result, help us to reduce our vulnerability to changes in demand. Through continuous monitoring of sell-
through data and disciplined product lifecycle management, in particular for our major product franchises, 
we are able to better detect demand patterns and prevent overexposure. By leveraging our promotion 
partnerships and by carefully orchestrating launch events across markets and channels, we intend to 
maintain brand desire and consumer demand at a constantly high level. Utilizing external insights and 
capabilities in product creation helps us strengthen our product offering and drive consumer demand, 
brand desire, market share and profitability 
Risks related to the competitive and retail environment 
Changes in the competitive landscape and the retail environment could impact the company’s success. 
Strategic alliances among competitors and/or retailers, the increase in retailers’ own private label 
businesses and intense competition for consumers, production capacity and promotion partnerships 
between well-established industry peers and new market entrants pose a substantial risk to adidas. This 
could lead to harmful competitive behavior, such as sustained periods of discounting in the marketplace or 
intense bidding for promotion partnerships. Failure to recognize and respond to consolidation in the retail 
industry could lead to increased dependency on particular retail partners, reduced bargaining power and, 
consequently, margin erosion. Sustained pricing pressure in key markets could threaten the company’s 
financial performance and the competitiveness of our brand. Aggressive competitive practices could also 
drive increases in marketing costs and market share losses, thus hurting the company’s profitability and 
market position. The inability to adjust our distribution strategy in a timely manner to a changing retail 
industry, which is experiencing rapid substitution of physical retail stores by digital commerce platforms 
as well as increasing connectivity between physical and digital retail, could result in sales and profit

shortfalls. A decline in the attractiveness of particular shopping locations such as shopping malls could 
lead to sales shortfalls in our customers’ and our own stores, higher inventory in the marketplace, 
increased clearance activity and margin pressure.  
To mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor and analyze information on our competitors and markets 
in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely 
reacting to such changes. This enables us to proactively adjust our marketing and sales activities (e.g. 
product launches, selective pricing adjustments) when needed. We also continuously and closely monitor 
numerous indicators (e.g. order placement, sell-through rates at the point of sale, average selling prices, 
discounts, store traffic) that help us identify changes in the retail environment and quickly take 
appropriate action such as closing or remodeling our own stores. We constantly adjust our segmentation 
strategies to ensure that the right product is sold at the right point of sale to the right consumer at an 
appropriate price. Continuous investment in research and development ensures that we remain innovative 
and distinct from competitors. We also pursue a strategy of entering into long-term agreements with key 
promotion partners such as FC Bayern Munich, James Harden, or Mikaela Shiffrin. In addition, our product 
and communication initiatives are designed to increase brand desire, drive market share growth, and 
strengthen our brands’ market position.   
Business partner risks 
adidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative 
partners, innovation partners, retail partners or suppliers of goods or services. As a result, the company is 
exposed to a multitude of business partner risks. 
We work with strategic partners in various areas of our business (e.g. product creation, manufacturing, 
research, and development) or distributors in a few selected markets whose approach might differ from 
our own business practices and standards, which could also negatively impact the company’s business 
performance and reputation. Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could 
negatively impact the company’s sales and profitability. Risks may also arise from a dependence on 
particular partners. For example, the overdependence on a supplier or customer increases the company’s 
vulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls and could lead to significant margin pressure. Business 
partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively affect the 
company’s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales for the 
company. Unethical business practices on the part of business partners or improper behavior of individual 
athletes, influencers or partners in the entertainment industry could have a negative spill-over effect on 
the company’s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even disrupt business activities. 
To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally 
include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our 
partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of 
promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. 
We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer 
business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted 
for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with 
suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any 
potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we 
enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and 
environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance 
coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To 
reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas 
works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, 
does not have a single-sourcing model.

Personnel risks 
Achieving the company’s strategic and financial objectives is highly dependent on our employees and their 
talents. In this respect, strong leadership and a performance-enhancing culture are critical to the 
company’s success. Therefore, ineffective leadership as well as the failure to install and maintain a 
performance-oriented culture that fosters diversity and inclusion and strong employee engagement 
amongst our workforce could also substantially impede our ability to achieve our goals. An ineffective, 
unbalanced, or insufficient allocation of resources to business activities could cause operational 
inefficiencies and result in lower employee engagement. In addition, global competition for highly qualified 
personnel remains fierce. As a result, the loss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to 
identify, recruit and retain highly qualified and skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our 
company pose risks to our business performance. 
To ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters diversity and inclusion, we redefined our framework for 
diversity and inclusion and launched a global policy on anti-harassment and anti-discrimination in 2020. 
Our workforce also takes part in global anti-racism and unconscious bias training in diversity and 
inclusion . To ensure effective leadership across the company, we have established a global Leadership 
Framework that is inclusive and articulates the behaviors expected of our leaders. 
To optimize staffing levels and resource allocation (i.e. having the right people with the right skillsets in 
the right roles at the right time), we have a dedicated workforce management process in place. We 
continuously invest in improving employer branding activities and have built a global recruiting 
organization to enhance our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global 
succession management helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and 
therefore reduces succession risk.
  
Risks related to media and stakeholder activities 
The company faces considerable risk if we are unable to uphold high levels of consumer awareness, 
affiliation, and purchase intent for our products. Adverse or inaccurate media coverage on our products or 
business practices as well as negative social media discussion may significantly harm the adidas’ 
reputation and brand image, lead to public misperception of the company’s business performance and 
eventually result in a sales slowdown. Similarly, certain activities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g. non-
governmental organizations, governmental institutions) could cause reputational damage, distract top 
management, and disrupt business activities. 
To mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders 
(e.g. consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental 
institutions ) on a continuous basis. In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes 
to ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments. We have also strengthened social 
media capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous 
monitoring of social media content related to the company’s products and activities and allow early 
management of potentially damaging social media discussion. On a case-by-case basis, we seek external 
advice from experts in communication and stakeholder management. 
IT and cyber security risks 
Theft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g. consumer data, employee data, 
product data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties or the inability to 
perform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order 
management, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support and financial reporting, are 
all dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures or cyber security threats to our 
infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in in reputational damage, 
regulatory penalties or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
To mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service 
continuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security 
program. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity 
management and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have 
also secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents. 
Project risks 
To effectively support further business growth and improve efficiency, adidas continuously invests in new 
projects such as the creation, implementation, expansion, harmonization or modernization of IT systems, 
distribution centers or office buildings. Ineffective project management could delay the execution of 
critical projects and lead to higher expenditures. Inadequate project planning and controlling as well as 
executional mistakes or ineffective change management could cause inefficiencies, delays, or business 
disruption, resulting in higher costs and sales shortfalls. Inappropriate project governance, prioritization 
and oversight of the project portfolio may lead to suboptimal resource allocation and undesired project 
results.  
We manage projects utilizing reviews by project teams as well as project steering committees to evaluate 
the progress, quality, and costs of those projects on a regular basis. This approach allows early detection 
of project risks and quick implementation of corrective action or timely cancelation of projects with a low 
chance of success. To ensure true end-to-end management of key projects we have established a network 
of program and project management departments across all main functions (i.e. Sales, Marketing, 
Operations, Finance, IT and Human Resources). We also work with external partners for project 
management support in areas where we do not have the required expertise or experience in-house. 
Risks related to tax and customs regulations 
Numerous laws and regulations regarding customs and taxes as well as changes in such laws and 
regulations affect the company’s business practices worldwide. Non-compliance with regulations 
concerning product imports (including calculation of customs values), intercompany transactions or 
income taxes could lead to substantial financial penalties and additional costs as well as negative media 
coverage and therefore reputational damage, for example in case of understatements or underpayments 
of corporate income taxes or customs duties. Changes in regulations regarding customs and taxes may 
also have a substantial impact on the company’s sourcing costs or income taxes. Therefore, we also create 
provisions in accordance with the relevant accounting regulations to account for potential disputes with 
customs or tax authorities. Increasingly aggressive positions taken by tax and customs authorities in 
audits could increase the potential impact of such risks and the likelihood that they materialize. 
We seek to manage tax and customs risks in a balanced way that bears an appropriate relationship to the 
operating structure, commercial and economic substance, and other business risks. To proactively 
manage such risks, we constantly seek expert advice from specialized independent law and tax advisory 
firms in areas such as process design, transaction advisory, compliance and tax or customs audits. 
Processes are in place requiring that attention is regularly directed to potential areas of tax or customs 
risk (e.g. a quarterly tax risk questionnaire) and the corporate tax and customs teams are involved in 
critical business transactions. Compliance with global tax and customs policies and controls is monitored 
by the Corporate Tax and Customs teams, internal controls experts and the Internal Audit department. We 
closely monitor changes in legislation to properly adopt regulatory requirements regarding customs and 
taxes, apply any available and applicable guidance from tax authorities and organizations such as the 
OECD, the World Customs Organization and the World Trade Organization and seek guidance from 
individual authorities, as appropriate, which for example may include requesting tax rulings from a tax 
authority. In addition, our internal legal, customs and tax teams advise our operational management 
teams to ensure appropriate and compliant business practices. Our specialized staff receive adequate 
training for their role and non-tax or non-customs staff are made aware of potential tax and customs

worldwide to make sure we adhere to customs and trade regulations at import and export to ensure the 
availability and obtain the required clearance of products to fulfill sales demand.  
► SEE SUSTAINABILITY 
Compliance risks 
As a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with 
such laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage. For example, 
non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation, may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to comply 
with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss of 
consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our 
employees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This 
includes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices, 
bribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace. 
Our Fair Play Compliance Framework helps us to prevent, detect and adequately respond to these risks. 
Our Global Policy Manual provides a framework for basic work procedures and processes and our Fair 
Play Code of Conduct stipulates that every employee and our business partners shall act ethically in 
compliance with the laws and regulations of the legal systems where they conduct company business. In 
addition, our Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance Officers guide and advise our 
operating managers regarding fraud and corruption topics. Furthermore, we utilize controls such as 
segregation of duties in IT systems and data analytics technology to prevent or detect fraudulent activities. 
We are also working with external partners and law firms to ensure we are informed about legal 
requirements across the globe, and we take appropriate action to ensure compliance. To mitigate the risk 
of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, we developed a 
global privacy management framework that introduces the company’s privacy principles and provides 
guidance for the use and deletion of personal information. This framework applies to all adidas businesses 
worldwide and also sets our expectations of third-party business partners for managing personal 
information for or on behalf of adidas. Our Global Privacy Officer and the Global Privacy department drive 
the operational establishment of the framework and monitoring capabilities to track and report its 
implementation. During the implementation, they are continuously providing further implementation 
guidance and training.

1 Includes opportunities related to sustainability which were shown as a separate category in 2019. 
Opportunities related to consumer demand and product offering 
Well-executed campaigns and marketing initiatives could increase brand desire and consumer appeal, 
which may drive full-price sell-through and result in higher-than-expected sales and profit. In addition, 
outstanding competitive performance of promotion partners such as individual athletes, club teams or 
national teams may further increase their popularity amongst consumers. As a result, adidas may 
generate higher sales of signature footwear or licensed apparel and accessories. We believe that our 
continued focus on product innovation and the ability to fully commercialize such innovation through an 
attractive product offering that resonates with consumers could provide further upside potential both in 
terms of sales and profit. In that respect, we see untapped potential particularly in sport-inspired apparel 
and in our women’s and kids’ business.  
We are also convinced that a continued focus on sustainability represents an opportunity for the company, 
in particular in the medium to long term. While we have already been very successful with our 
sustainability efforts, we see further upside potential leveraging our leadership position. Consumers are 
increasingly looking for products composed of more sustainable materials and manufactured in an 
innovative and yet socially and environmentally responsible way. By strengthening our sustainability focus 
in our marketing and product creation activities even further, we may generate additional sales growth 
and drive profitability improvements. 
► SEE SUSTAINABILITY  
Opportunities related to the distribution strategy 
The further expansion of our own e-commerce activities and the amplification of our digital partner 
commerce business could provide further upside potential in terms of sales and profit. In addition, 
improving order book conversion in our wholesale channel, where we clearly focus on partners that 
provide consumers with the best shopping experience and customer service, could result in higher-than-
expected sales and profit.
   
Opportunities related to data analytics 
Data and analytics play a crucial role in enabling fact-based decision-making. Therefore, we have a 
dedicated Data & Analytics team to drive business decision-making by leveraging the power of data. The 
continuous enhancement of our existing capabilities to build and scale insights-driven use cases and the 
use of the latest technology could bring value to our business operations across the entire company. As a

result, we see the opportunity to become faster and more efficient in our operations. We may increase 
visibility and understanding of consumer preferences, apply these insights in our product creation and, as 
a result, increase sales and reduce cost of sales. Leveraging data may also help us optimize order book 
management, inventory management and purchasing. All of this could result in improved financial 
performance. 
Opportunities related to faster-than-expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic 
Effective measures against the coronavirus pandemic (e.g. improved therapies and vaccination programs) 
could lead to a faster-than-expected recovery of the economy and the sporting goods industry. This could 
result in faster-than-expected growth of adidas net sales and profit. Furthermore, the sports industry 
could benefit from long-term trends amplified by the coronavirus pandemic such as the increasing 
penetration of sportswear (‘athleisure’) as well as rising awareness for health and wellness. These trends 
could positively impact adidas’ net sales growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory and currency opportunities 
Favorable exchange rate developments can potentially have a positive impact on the company’s financial 
results. Translation effects from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our company’s 
functional currency, the euro, might also positively impact our company’s financial performance. 
Legislative and regulatory changes such as the elimination of trade barriers due to free trade agreements  
can create cost savings or potentially open up new channels of distribution and, as a result, positively 
impact profitability. 
     
Opportunities related to tax regulations 
The potential release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets or the release of tax risk reserves 
could positively impact income tax expense. In addition, changes in local tax regulations may offer the 
company the option to realize benefits that could result in a reduction of tax expenses and higher net 
income. 
Personnel opportunities  
Creating and managing a performance-oriented culture that fosters diversity and inclusion as well as 
leadership accountability and clear values in the workplace could lead to increased diversity of thought, 
increased creativity and innovation and higher employee satisfaction and engagement. This may positively 
impact the company’s financial performance. A workforce that includes diverse talent and reflects the 
diversity of our customers and consumers, helps us better serve the communities we work in and 
strengthen brand reputation among our consumers, which could potentially create a competitive 
advantage and positively impact top- and bottom-line performance.

AND OUTLOOK 
ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE VERSUS TARGETS 
We communicate our financial targets on an annual basis. We also provide updates throughout the year as 
appropriate. In 2020, financial results were significantly impacted by the negative effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Exceptional growth in e-commerce could only partially compensate for the adverse 
effects of far-reaching lockdown measures and temporary physical store closures. As purchasing behavior 
continued to shift toward online channels, our digital platforms facilitated consumer engagement, 
seamless personal experiences and brand building even in times of social distancing. Against this 
backdrop, accelerating global trends such as the increasing penetration of sportswear (‘athleisure’) and 
rising awareness for health and wellness further supported the company’s sequential recovery throughout 
the year. As uncertainties toward the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic prevailed throughout 
2020, especially around the extension of lockdowns and store closures, the company was not able to 
provide an outlook for the full year 2020 including that impact. Instead, we provided quarterly outlook 
statements and delivered top- and bottom-line results in line with these guidances.

In 2020, revenues decreased 14% on a currency-neutral basis, due to currency-neutral sales declines 
across all market segments except for Russia/CIS, where revenues remained flat. Our direct-to-consumer 
business grew at a high single-digit rate, with e-commerce recording another year of exceptional growth. 
In the second half of the year, our business started to recover as the company focused on healthy 
inventories, profitable sell-through and disciplined wholesale sell-in. Accordingly, gross margin ended the 
year at 49.7%, reflecting a decrease of 2.3 percentage points. A more favorable channel mix driven by 
exceptional growth in e-commerce and lower sourcing costs partially compensated for a less favorable 
pricing mix due to increased promotional activity and negative currency developments. As anticipated, the 
operating result turned positive in the second half of the year while operating profit for the year 2020 as a 
whole declined 72% to € 751 million. Accordingly, operating margin decreased 7.5 percentage points to 
3.8%. Net income from continuing operations decreased 78% to € 429 million.

In 2020, average operating working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year at a level of 23.5%, 
which reflects a year-over-year increase of 5.4 percentage points, despite the company’s inventory 
normalization progressing according to plan in the second half of the year. Capital expenditure decreased 
38% to € 442 million in 2020, as the company prioritized short-term financial flexibility amid heightened 
uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Beyond our financial performance, we also actively manage non-financial KPIs. 
► SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
In 2020 the strength of our brands was mainly reflected in the exceptional growth in e-commerce, while 
we protected market share gains in a promotional environment in strategic growth markets North 
America and Greater China. 
⌐ Our diligence and discipline in sustainability matters continues to yield 
strong results and recognition for our company. In 2020, 71% of all polyester used for our apparel and 
footwear ranges was already recycled polyester. With that, we are ahead of our plan to use only recycled 
polyester from 2024 onward. Furthermore, through collective measures and technical support, our 
suppliers were able to exceed all our five-year environmental targets on energy, water, and waste. In 2020, 
we continued to leverage People Pulse as an important feedback channel for our corporate employees as 
we maintained our global approach to measure the level of employee satisfaction. In a survey conducted in 
September, employee Net Promoter Scores (eNPS) increased compared to the last survey conducted at 
the end of 2019. Therefore, feedback of the employees was very positive. We continued to openly discuss 
results and drive areas of improvement, while gaining insights toward the employee experience at 
adidas.

ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
Our Risk Management team aggregates all risks and opportunities identified through the half-yearly risk 
and opportunity assessment process. Results from this process are analyzed and reported to the 
Executive Board accordingly. In addition, the Executive Board discusses and assesses risks and 
opportunities on a regular basis. Compared to the prior year, our assessment of certain risks has changed 
in terms of likelihood of occurrence and/or potential financial impact. As a result, the overall adidas risk 
profile has slightly worsened compared to the prior year. However, considering the potential financial 
impact as well as the likelihood of the risks explained in this report materializing, and considering the 
strong balance sheet as well as the current business outlook, we do not foresee any material jeopardy to 
the viability of the company as a going concern. In 2020, the company obtained investment grade ratings 
from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s and strengthened its liquidity and financial flexibility. We remain 
confident that our earnings strength forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides 
the resources necessary to pursue the opportunities available to the company. 
► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL OUTLOOK 
In March 2021, adidas unveiled ‘Own the Game’, our strategy 2025, which defines strategic priorities and 
objectives for the period up to 2025. The strategy is focused on capturing consumer-driven opportunities 
which, in turn, is expected to spur above industry top- and sustainable bottom-line growth. 
We project currency-neutral revenues to increase at a rate of between 8% and 10% per annum on average 
between 2021 and 2025. Our bottom-line is expected to grow sustainably, as we expect net income from 
continuing operations to increase by an average of between 16% and 18% per annum in the four-year 
period between 2021 and 2025.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Following the revenue decline experienced in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, we project significant 
top-line improvements in 2021. In addition, long-term industry trends such as increasing sports 
participation, the growing penetration of sports-inspired apparel and footwear (‘athleisure’) and 
digitalization are set to drive sales growth. As a result, we expect sales to increase at a mid- to high-teens 
rate on a currency-neutral basis in 2021. An increase in gross margin and continued strict cost control will 
also drive strong profitability improvements. Supported by operating margin expansion, net income from 
continuing operations is projected to increase to a level of between € 1.25 billion and € 1.45 billion in 2021. 
This outlook has been prepared excluding the Reebok business. 
► SEE OUTLOOK 
We believe our outlook for 2021 realistically describes the underlying development of the company. 
However, the outlook for 2021 as outlined in this report is subject to change depending on further 
developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, ongoing uncertainties regarding the 
economic outlook and consumer sentiment in both developed and developing economies as well as re-
escalating trade tensions represent risks to the achievement of our stated financial goals and aspirations. 
No other material event between the end of 2020 and the publication of this report has altered our view.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
NOTES 
adidas AG is a listed German stock corporation and parent of the adidas Group located at Adi-Dassler-
Str. 1, 91074 Herzogenaurach, Germany, and is entered into the commercial register at the Local Court of 
Fürth (HRB 3868). adidas AG and its subsidiaries (collectively ‘adidas’, ‘the Group’ or ‘the company’) 
design, develop, produce and market a broad range of athletic and sports lifestyle products. 
01 GENERAL  
The consolidated financial statements of adidas AG as at December 31, 2020 comprise adidas AG and its 
subsidiaries and are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as to 
be applied in the European Union (EU) as at December 31, 2020, and the additional requirements pursuant 
to § 315e section 1 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). 
The following new standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations are effective for financial years beginning on January 1, 2020 and have been applied for the 
first time to these consolidated financial statements: 
─ Definition of a Business – Amendment to IFRS 3 (EU effective date: January 1, 2020): The amendment 
provides additional guidance in order to help entities determine whether they have acquired a business 
or a group of assets. This amendment did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
─ Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39 (EU effective date: 
January 1, 2020): The amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements, so that entities 
would apply those hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark on 
which the hedged cash flows and cash flows from the hedging instrument are based will not be altered 
as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments apply for all hedging relationships 
that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. During the financial years 2019 and 
2020, adidas did not conclude or possess any hedge instruments which were affected by the changes. 
Therefore, this amendment did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
─ Definition of Material – Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (EU effective date: January 1, 2020): The 
amendment clarifies the definition of ‘material’ and aligns the definition used in the Conceptual 
Framework with the accounting standards themselves. This amendment did not have any material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
─ General Amendments – References to the Conceptual Framework (EU effective date: January 1, 
2020): The amendments update references to the Conceptual Framework in individual standards. 
These amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
New standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and interpretations are 
usually not applied by adidas before the EU effective date. 
The following new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), endorsed by the EU, and 
which are effective for financial years beginning after January 1, 2020, have not been applied in preparing 
these consolidated financial statements :

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
─ Deferral of IFRS 9 – Amendment to IFRS 4 (IASB effective date: January 1, 2021): The amendment 
provides two optional solutions to reduce the impact of the differing effective dates of IFRS 9 and IFRS 
17. IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts’ is currently not applied by the company. Therefore, the amendment is 
not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
─ Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Phase 2 – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 
16 (IASB effective date: January 1, 2021): The amendments offer a practical expedient for financial 
instrument modifications and lease modifications, specific relief from discontinuing hedging 
relationships, and the amendment introduces new disclosure requirements. The impacts of the 
amendment on the consolidated financial statements are currently under evaluation. 
─ Covid-19- Related Rent Concessions - Amendment to IFRS 16 (EU effective date: June 1, 2020): This 
amendment provides lessees with the choice of an exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-
related rent concessions are to be treated as lease modifications as defined by IFRS 16. If the 
exemption is applied, the lessee recognizes the effects of the rent concession in the consolidated 
income statement in the period in which it occurs. adidas has decided not to apply the exemption; thus, 
the amendment will not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
The following new standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations were issued by the IASB. These are not yet endorsed by the EU and hence have not been 
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: 
─ Insurance Contracts – IFRS 17 including Amendments (IASB effective date: January 1, 2023): The new 
standard regulates the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain insurance 
contracts that influence the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Insurance 
contracts which the entity issues, reinsurance contracts the entity holds, and investment contracts 
with discretionary participation features issued by the entity are all within the scope of the standard. 
IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’, which is currently not applied by the company. 
Therefore, the standard is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
─ Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendment to IFRS 3 (IASB effective date: January 1, 
2022): The amendment updates the references surrounding the Conceptual Framework and clarifies 
that an acquirer does not recognize contingent assets acquired in a business combination. The 
amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
─ Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – 
Amendment to IAS 1 (IASB effective date: January 1, 2023): The amendment clarifies the classification 
of current and non-current liabilities when presenting amounts in the statement of financial position. 
This amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
─ Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendment to IAS 16 (IASB 
effective date: January 1, 2022): The amendment prohibits deducting any proceeds from selling items 
produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment. These are instead recognized in 
the income statement as they occur. The amendment is not expected to have any material impact on 
the consolidated financial statements. 
─ Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendment to IAS 37 (IASB effective date: January

Taxation in Fair Value Measurements (Amendment to IAS 41). The improvements are not expected to 
have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
The consolidated financial statements have in principle been prepared on the historical cost basis with the 
exception of certain items in the statement of financial position such as financial instruments, derivative 
financial instruments and plan assets, which are measured at fair value. 
Business development in 2020 was significantly impacted by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Estimates and assumptions relevant to the financial statements were made to the best of our knowledge, 
based on current events and actions. Due to the ongoing situation, it is difficult to predict the impact on 
assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic is 
described in the individual Notes to the consolidated financial statements, if relevant, and include in 
particular accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, 
trademarks, financial instruments as well as other operating expenses.

02 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidation, accounting and 
valuation principles described below. 
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidas AG and all its direct and 
indirect subsidiaries, which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles. An entity is 
considered a subsidiary if it is controlled by adidas AG. Control exists when adidas is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. 
The number of consolidated subsidiaries developed as follows in 2020 and 2019, respectively: 
Number of consolidated subsidiaries 
     
  2020  2019 
January 1 
 125  128 
First-time consolidated subsidiaries  –  4 
Thereof: newly founded  –  3 
Thereof: control obtained in accordance with IFRS 10  –  1 
Deconsolidated/divested subsidiaries  (1)  (5) 
Intercompany mergers  (3)  (2) 
December 31  121  125 
 
The subsidiaries are held either directly by adidas AG or indirectly via the two holding companies adidas 
Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH in Germany or adidas International B.V. in the Netherlands. 
A schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment I to the consolidated financial 
statements.
 This schedule comprises information about the name, domicile, currency and equity of all 
consolidated subsidiaries as well as the respective share held in the capital of these subsidiaries. 
Furthermore, the schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is published on the electronic platform of the 
German Federal Gazette. 
► SEE SHAREHOLDINGS 
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation, all acquired assets and liabilities are recognized in the 
statement of financial position at fair value at the acquisition date. A debit difference between the 
acquisition cost and the proportionate fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized 
as goodwill. A credit difference is recorded in the income statement after a reassessment of the fair value 
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities has been performed. In cases where not all of the shares 
in the investment in a subsidiary are acquired, a non-controlling interest measured initially as a 
proportionate share of net assets is recognized at the date of the first-time consolidation. 
Acquisitions of additional investments in subsidiaries which are already controlled are recorded as equity 
transactions. Therefore, neither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities nor gains or losses are 
recognized. Any difference between the cost for such an additional investment and the carrying amount of 
the net assets at the acquisition date is recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions as well as any unrealized gains and losses arising from 
intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Financial assets are classified and measured according to IFRS 9. All purchases and sales of financial 
assets, with the exception of trade receivables, are recognized on the trade date and initially measured at 
fair value. At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are 
measured at their transaction price. Subsequently, a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument), fair value through other comprehensive 
income (equity instrument) or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is measured at amortized 
cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at fair value through profit or loss: a 
financial asset which is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect 
contractual cash flows (business model ‘Hold to collect’) and the financial asset’s contractual terms give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

A debt security is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets both of the 
following conditions and is not designated at fair value through profit or loss: financial asset which is held 
within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets (business model ‘Hold to collect and sell’) and its contractual terms give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
In principle, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. At 
initial recognition, an entity may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income 
subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for 
trading nor a contingent consideration acquired by a purchaser in a business combination. This election is 
made on an investment-by-investment basis. 
All financial assets which are not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss.  
Financial assets are only reclassified when the business model for managing financial assets is changed, 
in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified.

Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying 
the spot exchange rate valid at the transaction date to the foreign currency amount. 
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries, monetary items denominated in non-functional 
currencies of the subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in the 
income statement. 
Assets and liabilities of the company’s non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated using 
closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date into the presentation currency, the euro, which is also 
the functional currency of adidas AG. For practical reasons, revenues and expenses are translated at 
average rates for the period which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates. All 
cumulative differences from the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in 
exchange rates are included in a separate item within shareholders’ equity without affecting the income 
statement. 
A summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as follows:

Hyperinflation 
To reflect changes in purchasing power at the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of non-monetary 
assets and liabilities, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income of subsidiaries in hyperinflationary 
economies are restated in terms of a measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. These are indexed 
using a general price index in accordance with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies’. In contrast, no restatement is required for monetary assets and liabilities carried at amounts 
current at the end of the balance sheet date  because they represent money held, to be received or to be 
paid. 
► SEE NOTE 35 
Gains and losses from hyperinflation are included in the financial result. 
Non-monetary assets that have been restated following the guidance in IAS 29 are still subject to 
impairment assessment in accordance with the guidance in the relevant IFRS.

Discontinued operations 
A component of the company’s business whose operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the company is classified as a 
discontinued operation if the component either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and:  
─ represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations, 
─ is  part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area 
of operations, or 
─ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative consolidated income 
statement and consolidated statement of cash flows are restated and presented as if the operation had 
been classified as such from the start of the comparative year. 
Derivative financial instruments 
adidas uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency options, forward exchange contracts, stock 
price options as well as forward stock transactions and currency swaps, to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange and stock price risks. In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the company does not enter into 
transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value, 
and subsequently also measured at their fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gains or 
losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, adidas 
designates derivatives as either a hedge of a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation. In applying cash flow hedge accounting only the spot element of foreign 
exchange deals and the intrinsic value of currency options are designated (spot-to-spot designation). 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or net 
investments that are effective as defined in IFRS 9 are recognized in equity. 
adidas applies the ‘cost of hedging’ approach for dedicated cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of 
the time value component of options, as well as the forward element in forward contracts are recognized 
separately in equity. When the effectiveness is not 100%, the ineffective portion of the change in the fair 
value is recognized in the income statement. Accumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to the 
income statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income 
statement.  
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The 
effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of 
the borrowing are recognized in equity with the exception of the cross-currency basis spread. 
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the company’s risk 
management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IFRS 9.  
adidas documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects as well as the risk 
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions at transaction 
inception. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific firm commitments 
and forecast transactions. adidas also assesses the effectiveness and possible ineffectiveness of its 
hedged derivatives by using generally accepted methods of effectiveness testing, such as the ‘hypothetical

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
derivative method’ or the ‘dollar offset method’. The economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item is qualitatively and quantitatively    ascertainable and adidas judges the 
effectiveness of the hedging relationship with the hypothetical derivative method. The main sources of 
expected ineffectiveness are due to changes in the credit risk and in the timing of the hedged transactions. 
The fair values of currency options, forward exchange contracts and forward stock transactions are 
determined on the basis of market conditions on the reporting date. The fair value of a currency option is 
determined using generally accepted models. The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the 
remaining term of the option but also by additional factors, such as the actual foreign exchange rate and 
the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. The company determines fair values taking the 
counterparty risk into consideration. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with maturities 
of three months or less from the date of acquisition such as commercial papers and investments in money 
market funds. 
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Part of cash equivalents includes 
investments in money market funds. Classification and measurement under IFRS 9 are performed based 
on the company’s business model for managing these financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics. Investments in money market funds contain cash flows other than those of principal and 
interest on principal. As a result, those investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
Short-term financial assets 
Investments in money market funds which do not fulfill the criteria of cash equivalents are shown under 
short-term financial assets. These are classified at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair 
value are recognized in the consolidated income statement as they occur. 
Accounts receivable 
Accounts receivable are recognized at the transaction price, which represents the amount of consideration 
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a 
customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Subsequently, these are measured at 
amortized cost. 
Other financial assets 
Other financial assets are classified and measured under IFRS 9 based on the company’s business model 
for managing these assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Those other financial assets that 
give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and are assigned to the 
business model ‘Hold to collect’ are measured at amortized cost. adidas mainly has security deposits and 
receivables from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces which fall under this category. 
Other financial assets which are neither within the business model ‘Hold to collect’ nor ‘Hold to collect and 
sell’ are measured at fair value through profit or loss. This category mainly includes secured promissory 
notes and earn-out components. 
Long-term financial assets 
Long-term financial assets are distinguished between debt and equity instruments and classified 
according to IFRS 9 as follows: 
Debt instruments are measured depending on the company’s business model for managing financial 
assets and the contractual cash flows. Only financial assets that are held within the business model ‘Hold

to collect’ with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows which represent solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on a specific date are measured at amortized 
cost. adidas classifies certain loans within this category. All other financial assets which do not fulfill one 
of these criteria are measured at fair value – either at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (debt). adidas has no long-term financial assets in the category fair 
value through comprehensive income (debt instrument) and shows loans which do not fulfill the 
contractual cash flow characteristics in the category fair value through profit or loss. 
Generally, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.  
adidas has designated certain investments as equity securities  at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (equity), because these investments represent investments that the company intends to hold for 
long-term strategic purposes. The designation of certain equity instruments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (equity) is based on a strategic Management decision. 
Inventories 
Finished goods and merchandise are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Costs are determined using a standard valuation method, the 
‘average cost method’. Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials, direct labor and the compo-
nents of the manufacturing overheads which can be reasonably attributed to finished goods. The allocation of 
overheads is based on the planned average utilization. The net realizable value allowances are computed 
consistently throughout the company based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 
Assets/liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale  
Assets/liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale are primarily non-current assets and 
liabilities expected to be realized principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. These are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held 
for sale are not depreciated on a straight-line basis.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are measured at amortized cost. This comprises all costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by Management less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is recognized for those assets, with the exception of land and construction in progress, over 
the estimated useful life utilizing the ‘straight-line method’ and taking into account any potential residual 
value, except where the ‘declining-balance method’ is more appropriate in light of the actual utilization 
pattern. Parts of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item are depreciated separately. 
Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Estimated useful lives of property, plant, and equipment 
   
  Years 
Land  indefinite 
Buildings and leasehold improvements  20 – 50 
Furniture and fixtures  3 – 5 
Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment  2 – 10

Expenditure for repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Renewals and improvements are 
capitalized and depreciated separately, if the recognition criteria are met. 
Impairment losses on non-financial assets 
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g. property, plant and equipment as well as 
intangible assets including goodwill) might be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined. This is 
measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal (net disposal price) and value in use. Non-
financial items measured at the recoverable amount primarily relate to impaired property, plant and 
equipment being measured based on value in use or on fair value taking unobservable inputs (e.g. profit or 
cash flow planning) into account. The fair value is measured at Level 3 according to IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’. 
An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses or reported in goodwill impairment losses if 
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units which represent 
the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. If 
there is an impairment loss for a group of cash-generating units, first the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the group of cash-generating units is reduced. Subsequently, provided that the recoverable 
amount is lower than the carrying amount, the other non-current assets of the group of cash-generating 
units are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the group of cash-
generating units. In allocating an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an individual asset is not 
reduced below its fair value. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated 
to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cash-generating unit and groups of cash-
generating units. 
The impairment test for trademarks with indefinite useful lives is performed on the relevant level of cash-
generating units. 
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (in 
particular trademarks) and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually on 
September 30 for impairment. In the case that indicators for impairment are present at any point in time 
other than on September 30, these assets are also tested for impairment at this point in time. 
An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible. With respect to all other impaired assets, an 
impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed affecting the income statement if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortization) if no impairment loss had been 
recognized. 
Impairment losses on financial assets 
Impairment losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (debt instrument) are recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’. The standard requires that not only historical data, but also future expectations and 
projections are taken into consideration when accounting for impairment losses (‘expected credit loss’ 
model). 
adidas consistently applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all 
accounts receivable. In order to calculate a collective loss allowance, all accounts receivable sharing 
similar credit risk characteristics are allocated into several portfolios based on geographical regions and

macroeconomic indicators. Historical payment and aging patterns for accounts receivable are analyzed 
individually for each of the portfolios to determine the probability of default which is further adjusted by 
forward-looking factors derived primarily from the Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads of the countries 
where adidas runs its operations and which are impacted by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic as of 
December 31, 2020. The adjusted probability of default is then applied in combination with a loss given 
default and exposure at default as a percentage rate to calculate the expected credit loss for each portfolio 
and aging bucket. The percentage rates are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they reflect the 
latest data on credit risk. In case objective evidence of credit impairment is observed for accounts 
receivable from a specific customer, a detailed analysis of the credit risk is performed, and an appropriate 
individual loss allowance is recognized for this customer. Accounts receivable are considered to be in 
default when it is expected that the debtor will not fulfill its credit obligations toward adidas. 
Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to a general impairment approach 
under IFRS 9. adidas applies the low credit risk exemption for the majority of such instruments due to the 
low credit risk for these investments, which is based upon the investment grade of their counterparties 
(defined by the company as equivalent of BBB+ or higher). A significant increase of credit risk is assumed 
for cash and cash equivalents when the instruments are more than 30 days past due. adidas monitors the 
credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents taking into consideration the economic environment, 
external credit ratings and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions and using established 
exposure limits. Expected credit loss of cash and cash equivalents is calculated based on the probability of 
default and recovery rates derived from CDS spreads or external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cash 
and cash equivalents are considered to be in default when they are more than 90 days past due. 
Other financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 impairment analysis include mainly security deposits as 
well as accounts receivable regarding credit card companies and electronic marketplaces.  
Objective evidence that credit impairment of financial assets has occurred includes, for instance, 
significant financial difficulty of the debtor/issuer, indications of their potential bankruptcy, the 
deterioration of the market for their products and general macroeconomic problems. The gross carrying 
amount of financial assets is written off when adidas, based on a case-by-case assessment, assumes that 
their recovery is no longer possible. 
Impairment losses on accounts receivable are presented in the line item ‘Impairment losses (net) on 
accounts receivable and contract assets’ while impairment losses on all other financial assets are shown

adidas assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease according to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ at the inception of 
the contract. IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset if the lessee has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use 
of the identified asset (e.g. by having the exclusive right to use the asset throughout that period) and the 
right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. 
In its role as a lessee, adidas leases various types of assets, particularly buildings (retail stores, offices, 
warehouses, etc.), land, technical equipment and machinery (warehouse equipment, production machines, 
etc.), motor vehicles, computer hardware as well as furniture and fixtures. Lease contracts are typically 
negotiated for fixed periods of up to 99 years but may include extension or termination options. Lease 
terms are negotiated individually and may contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

adidas makes use of the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e. value of the underlying asset, when new, is € 5,000 or less) and 
short-term leases (shorter than twelve months and the agreement does not include a purchase option). The 
lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. Real estate and automobile leases are excluded from the classification as ‘low-value assets’. 
Furthermore, adidas exercises the option for lessees to combine lease payments with payments for non-
lease components in the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset for all lease asset classes 
except for real estate. 
adidas recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement 
date. At the commencement date, adidas initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the 
lease payments that are not paid at that date. This includes fixed payments (including in-substance fixed 
payments), less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments based on an index or a rate, 
amounts expected to be payable by adidas under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a 
purchase option if adidas is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for 
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Variable lease payments 
are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, adidas uses its incremental 
borrowing rate. Generally, adidas uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, adjusted to 
reflect the country-specific risk, the contract currency-specific risk and the lease term. 
After the commencement date, lease payments are split into redemption payments and interest payments. 
The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest cost on the 
lease liability using the effective interest rate and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments 
made. The carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured provided any reassessments/lease modifica-
tions occur (including changes in the assessment of whether an extension or termination option is reasonably 
certain to be exercised).  
At the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the 
amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and 
an estimate of costs to be incurred by adidas in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring 
the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and 
conditions of the lease. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. In 
principle, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful 
life of the leased asset, whichever is shorter. 
adidas applies judgment in determining the lease term for lease contracts including extension or 
termination options. The assessment of whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised has an 
impact on the lease term and therefore may significantly affect the measurement of lease liabilities and 
right-of-use assets, respectively. 
Lease contract renegotiations that result in changes to the original contractual conditions, e.g. changes in 
scope, consideration (including discounts and concessions) or lease term contain judgments and are 
treated as lease modifications, even if they are a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Depending on the 
circumstances of the renegotiation, lease modifications are either accounted for as a new separate 
contract or they trigger a remeasurment of the lease liability using the discounted future lease payments. 
In the latter case, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset with, in some instances, a 
difference recognized in profit or loss.

Lease reassessments are the result of changes in assumptions or judgments, such as changes in lease 
term due to amended estimates surrounding existing extension and termination options.It is necessary to 
remeasure the lease liability using the discounted or existing future lease payments and make a 
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. 
In rare cases, adidas acts as a lessor when the company signs sub-leasing contracts for real estate 
properties with third parties. These contracts are not material to the company’s consolidated financial 
statements. 
adidas does not own any investment property. 
Goodwill  
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business 
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. This results when the purchase 
cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill 
arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
assets received, liabilities and contingent liabilities are treated as assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the respective reporting entity, and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of 
the initial consolidation.  
Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity. 
Intangible assets (except goodwill) 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (in particular trademarks) are recognized at purchase cost 
and are subject to an impairment test at least on an annual basis (‘impairment-only’ approach). 
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are valued at amortized cost. Amortization is calculated on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, taking into account any potential residual value. 
Expenditure during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets is capitalized as 
incurred if it fulfills the recognition criteria under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
   
  Years 
Trademarks  indefinite

Software  5 – 7 
Patents, trademarks and licenses  5 – 15

Research and development 
Research costs are expensed in full as incurred. Development costs for internally generated intangible 
assets are also expensed as incurred if they do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible 
Assets’, paragraph 57. 
Borrowings and other liabilities  
Borrowings (e. g. eurobonds) and other liabilities are recognized at fair value using the ‘effective interest 
method’, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, long-term borrowings are stated at

amortized cost using the ‘effective interest method’. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the term of the borrowing. 
Compound financial instruments (e.g. convertible bonds) are divided into a liability component shown under 
borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights. The equity component is included 
in the capital reserve. The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the interest and 
principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights, applying risk-adjusted interest rates. 
The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the ‘effective interest method’. The 
equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial 
instrument and the fair value of the liability component and is reported within equity. There is no subsequent 
measurement of the equity component. At initial recognition, directly attributable transaction costs are 
assigned to the equity and liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective carrying amounts. 
Provisions and accrued liabilities 
Provisions are recognized where a present obligation (legal or constructive) to third parties has been 
incurred as a result of a past event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow of 
resources, and where the timing or amount is uncertain. Non-current provisions are discounted if the 
effect of discounting is material.  
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have 
not been paid, invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees. Here, 
however, the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not uncertain. 
Pensions and similar obligations  
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the company’s obligations for 
defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined 
separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their service during the 
current and prior periods. These benefit accruals are discounted to calculate their present value, and the 
fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net liability. The discount rate is set on 
the basis of yields of high-quality fixed-rate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a 
deep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency. Otherwise, government bond yields are used as 
a reference. Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the ‘projected unit credit method’ in 
accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognized as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
Contingent liabilities  
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
adidas. Additionally, contingent liabilities may be present obligations that arise from past events, but which 
are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation, or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent 
liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed and 
explained in the Notes.
 ► SEE NOTE 40 
Treasury shares 
When adidas AG shares are repurchased and recognized as treasury shares, the amount of the 
consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognized as a 
deduction from equity. The nominal value of € 1 per treasury share is debited to share capital. Any 
premium or discount to the nominal value is shown as an adjustment to the retained earnings. If treasury 
shares are sold or re-issued, the nominal value of the shares will be credited to share capital and the 
amount exceeding the nominal value will be added to the retained earnings.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Contract assets and contract liabilities 
Contract assets and liabilities are recognized in connection with revenues arising from the licensing-out of 
the right to use the adidas and Reebok brands to third parties. Contract assets represent the company’s 
right to consideration in exchange for rights that adidas has transferred to a third party and contract 
liabilities represent the company’s obligation to transfer rights to a third party for which adidas has 
already received consideration from the third party. The subsequent measurement of contract assets 
follows the impairment-only approach for financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9. Contract liabilities 
are measured at the expected settlement amount. 
Revenue 
Revenue derived from the sale of goods is recognized when adidas has satisfied the respective 
performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer. The goods are transferred at 
the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods. The timing of the transfer of 
control depends on the individual terms of the sales agreement (terms of delivery). 
The amount of recognizable revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of returns, early payment discounts and rebates. 
Under certain conditions and in accordance with contractual agreements, the company’s customers have 
the right to return products and to either exchange them for similar or other products or to return the 
products against the issuance of a credit note. Amounts for estimated returns related to revenues are 
accrued based on past experience of average return rates and average actual return periods by means of a 
refund liability. The return assets are measured at the former carrying amount of the 
inventories/products, less any handling costs and any potential impairment. 
Provided that the customers meet certain predefined conditions, adidas grants its customers different 
types of globally aligned performance-based rebates. Examples include rebates for customers’ increasing 
adidas product sales,  for customer loyalty as well as for sell-out support, e. g. through retail 
space/franchise store management. As soon as it is assumed that the customer fulfills the requirements 
for being granted the rebate, this amount is accrued by means of an accrued liability for marketing and 
sales. Customer incentives which were not contractually agreed upon as well as promises that were 
implied by adidas’ customary business practice and did not bear the characteristics of a discount are 
accounted for as marketing and point-of-sale expenses. 
Customer incentives and options as well as any obligation for adidas to pay for the delivery of goods to the 
customer do not create separate performance obligations under IFRS 15 and are separated from revenue. 
In addition, adidas generates revenue from the licensing-out of the right to use the adidas and Reebok 
brands to third parties. The resulting sales-based royalty and commission income is recognized based on 
the contract terms on an accrual basis. Contracts with guaranteed minimum income result in contract 
assets and contract liabilities depending on the timing of yearly payments received from customers. The 
performance obligation related to these contract assets and liabilities is satisfied over the life of the 
contract, whereby payments are recorded as arranged in the contract with the customer. 
Advertising and promotional expenditure 
Advance payments for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses within other current and non-
current assets until the services are received, and upon receipt expensed in full. Significant costs for 
media campaigns are expensed on a straight-line basis over the intended duration of the media campaign. 
Promotional expenses including one-time up-front payments for promotion contracts are principally 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.

Interest  
Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred using the ‘effective interest method’ with the 
exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a 
qualifying asset. This interest is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset. 
Interest paid is presented within the net cash used in financing activities.  
Government grants 
adidas receives government grants in the form of subsidies, subventions or premiums from local, national 
or international government authorities such as those of the Free State of Bavaria, the Federal Republic of 
Germany and the European Union.  
Government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and 
that the company satisfies the conditions attached. 
Government grants are reported in the consolidated income statement as a deduction from the related 
expenses. 
Income taxes  
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the 
countries in which adidas operates.  
adidas computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base 
of its assets and liabilities as well as for tax loss carry-forwards. As it is not permitted to recognize a deferred 
tax liability for the initial recognition of goodwill, adidas does not compute any deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards which 
exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the entity 
concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognized in the income statement unless it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognized in equity.  
When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, adidas recognizes and measures current or 
deferred tax assets or liabilities applying the requirements of IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. On a case-by-case 
basis, adidas determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with 
one or more other uncertain tax treatments, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution 
of the uncertainty.  
Where it is not considered probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, adidas 
reflects the effects of the uncertainty by using one of the following methods, depending on which method 
better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty: 
─ the single most likely amount 
─ the expected value based on the sum of the probability-weighted amounts.  
In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profits (tax 
losses), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, adidas assumes that a taxation 
authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and will have full knowledge of all relevant 
information when making those examinations.

Share-based payment 
The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is determined by the fair 
value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.
 That cost is recognized in personnel 
expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which 
the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
►  SEE NOTE 28 
Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the fair 
value of awards at the grant date, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the 
company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. If the estimate is 
changed, even a credit in the income statement for the period can be possible as it reflects the movement 
in cumulative expenses from the beginning to the end of that period. 
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or 
service conditions have not been met. 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are generally 
measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where the fair value cannot be 
estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, 
measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service. 
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability 
incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the fair value of the 
liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with all changes in 
fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
Estimation uncertainties and judgments 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions and 
estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Although such estimates are based on the 
best of our knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these 
estimates. In 2020 assumptions and estimates were significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic 
and due to the ongoing situation future assumptions and estimates will be impacted by the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance 
sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the respective Notes, which include in particular 
accounts receivable, inventories
, right-of-use-assets, goodwill, trademarks, other provisions, pensions, 
derivatives, income taxes, as well as litigation and other legal risks.

03 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
The results of the Rockport, TaylorMade and CCM Hockey operations that were sold in previous periods 
are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement. 
The net result of discontinued operations presented in the consolidated income statement for the year 
ending December 31, 2020 mainly relates to a fair value adjustment of the earn-out component as well as 
actual earn-out received related to the sale of the TaylorMade business. The increase in fair value is 
attributable to adjusted future EBITDA-value estimates. In 2020, adidas received a cash consideration of 
US $ 50 million. The fair value of the earn-out component at December  31, 2020 amounts to 
US $ 15 million (2019: US $ 50 million). 
Gains from discontinued operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 in an amount of € 13 million 
(2019: gains of € 59 million) are entirely attributable to the shareholders of adidas AG. The tax expense in 
respect of discontinued operations is € 14 million (2019: tax benefit of € 4 million). 
Further information about the reporting of the Reebok business from the first quarter 2021 onward is

04 FIRST-TIME CONSOLIDATION/DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES 
AS WELL AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
In 2020, no disposals of subsidiaries or first-time consolidation took place. 
Effective as of December 2019, an amendment to the contractual arrangements existing between Agron, 
Inc. and adidas entered into force granting adidas the power to approve key financial and operational 
targets as well as the organizational structure of Agron, Inc. adidas has the right to, and is exposed to, the 
returns from its contractual business relations with Agron, Inc., which are dependent on the level of its net 
sales and overall profitability. As a result of the extended power, adidas has the ability to directly influence 
the amount of these variable returns and consequently obtained control over Agron, Inc. Therefore, a fair 
value of its assets and liabilities was consolidated for the first time into the company’s consolidated 
statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019. In addition, starting from January 1, 2020, income 
and expenses of Agron, Inc. will be included in the company’s consolidated income statement. As adidas 
holds no equity interests of Agron, Inc., both net assets as well as income and expenses are attributable 
entirely to the non-controlling interest. adidas has not transferred any consideration to the owners of 
Agron, Inc. in relation to the amendment of the contractual arrangements. The effect of the first-time 
consolidation was reflected entirely within the equity and neither goodwill nor a gain from a bargain 
purchase has been recognized. 
Agron, Inc. is engaged in the design, development and distribution of sports accessories, primarily under 
licenses from adidas America, Inc. These products are sold directly by Agron, Inc. to retailers in the USA. 
The following assets and liabilities of Agron, Inc. were recognized at the date of first-time consolidation in 
the company’s consolidated statement of financial position based on the fair value calculation:

An increase of the license agreement resulted from the final calculation of the fair values. As the 
adjustment was immaterial it was recognised in 2020. 
The following valuation methods for the recognized assets were applied: 
─ Inventories: The fair value of inventory was measured using the cost approach. Realized margins were 
added to the book values to calculate the selling price. Marketing and logistics costs were then 
deducted from the selling price. 
─ Other intangible assets: The fair value of the license agreement between Agron, Inc. and adidas 
America, Inc. was determined by discounting future profits after taxes until the end of the contract 
term on December 31, 2024.  
For the year ending December 31, 2019 no net sales as well as no income and expenses of Agron, Inc. 
were included in the company’s consolidated income statement. If the first-time consolidation had 
occurred on January 1, 2019, the company’s total net sales would have been € 24,055 million while net 
income attributable to shareholders would have remained unchanged at € 1,976 million for the year 
ending December 31, 2019.

05 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held by banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits. 
Short-term deposits are only shown as cash and cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The credit risk of cash and cash 
equivalents measured at amortized cost is insignificant due to their short-term maturity, counterparties’ 
investment grade credit ratings and established exposure limits. Therefore, adidas does not recognize any 
credit impairment losses for these financial assets. 
Further information about cash and cash equivalents is presented in these Notes.

Loss allowances at December 31  267  189 
 
Compared to December 31, 2019, the total loss allowance increased by € 78 million, which is 
predominantly a consequence of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Thereof € 6 million is related to the 
collective loss allowance mainly due to a deterioration of the accounts receivable ageing structure as well 
as higher allowance percentages due to an increase in the expected default rates. The individual loss 
allowance increased by € 72 million to reflect a higher credit risk of specific customers. 
As at December 31, 2020, the loss allowance for not credit-impaired accounts receivable in the amount of 
€ 241 million and credit-impaired accounts receivable in the amount of € 1 million was not recognized as 
adidas holds credit enhancement instruments, mainly in the form of credit insurance and bank 
guarantees, which mitigate the credit risk of those financial assets. 
There are no material balances of accounts receivable written off but subject to enforcement activity.

As a general principle, it is regularly assessed whether there are any indications that right-of-use assets 
might be impaired. Irrespective of the existence of such indications, right-of-use assets in adidas’ own-
retail stores are tested annually for impairment where the recoverable amount is calculated using the 
‘discounted cash flow method’ as part of determining the profitability of the adidas’ own-retail stores 
respectively. 
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, facts and circumstances indicated that non-current assets (e.g. 
property, plant, and equipment, right-of use assets and intangible assets including goodwill) might be 
impaired. In addition to the impairment testing for individual assets, impairment tests were carried out for 
all significant non-current assets at the respective level of cash-generating units due to this ‘triggering 
event’ and related reassessment of the business development, under consideration of the expected 
consequences of the coronavirus pandemic on March 31, June 30 and December 31, 2020. These were 
based on updated financial planning and estimates. Given the unforeseeable future consequences of the 
coronavirus pandemic, these estimates and judgments are subject to an increased level of uncertainty. 
However, future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to (additional) impairments 
and reversals of impairment losses.

Goodwill, net  1,208  1,257 
 
The majority of goodwill, which primarily relates to the acquisition of the Reebok business in 2006, is 
denominated in US dollars. A currency translation effect of negative € 49 million and positive € 12 million 
were recorded for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
adidas determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary on at least an annual basis. The impairment 
test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level 
within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This requires an 
estimation of the recoverable amount of the groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is 
allocated. The recoverable amount of a group of cash-generating units is determined based on its value in 
use. Estimating the value in use requires adidas to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows 
from the groups of cash-generating units and also to choose a suitable discount rate to calculate the 
present value of those cash flows. 
This calculation uses cash-flow projections based on the financial planning in line with our new strategy 
‘Own the Game’covering a five-year period in total. The planning is based on long-term expectations of the 
company and reflects in total for the groups of cash-generating units an average annual mid-single- to 
low-double-digit sales increase with varying forecast growth prospects for the different groups of cash-
generating units. Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to expand, primarily driven by an 
improvement in the gross margin, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The 
planning for capital expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience. The planning 
for future tax payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the individual groups of cash-
generating units. Cash flows beyond this five-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 
1.7% (2019: 1.7%). According to the company’s expectations, these growth rates do not exceed the long-
term average growth rate of the business sector in which the respective group of cash-generating units 
operates.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average 
market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for the 
respective group of cash-generating units. The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the 
specific equity and country risk of the respective group of cash-generating units. 
The groups of cash-generating units are defined as the regional markets which are responsible for the 
joint distribution of the adidas and Reebok brands as well as the other operating segments adidas Golf and 
Runtastic. The regional markets are Europe, adidas North America, Reebok North America, Asia-Pacific, 
Russia/CIS, Latin America, and Emerging Markets. The number of groups of cash-generating units 
amounted to a total of nine at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, there were indications of possible impairment on goodwill during the 
year ending December 31, 2020. In response to this ‘triggering event’, and taking into account the potential 
future impact of the coronavirus pandemic, impairment tests were carried out at the level of the cash-
generating units on March 31, June 30, September 30,  and December 31, 2020. These tests were based on 
updated financial planning and estimates. Given the unforeseeable future consequences of the corona-
virus pandemic, these estimates and judgments are subject to an increased level of uncertainty. The 
goodwill impairment tests revealed no need for goodwill impairment for the years ending December 31, 
2020 and 2019. 
The carrying amounts of acquired goodwill allocated to the respective groups of cash-generating units and 
the respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are as follows: 
Allocation of goodwill 
 
  Goodwill (€ in millions)  Discount rate (after taxes) 
  Dec. 31, 2020  Dec. 31, 2019  Dec. 31, 2020  Dec. 31, 2019

Emerging Markets  76  79  10.5%  9.0% 
Total  1,208  1,257     
    
A change in the discount rate by up to approximately 5.2 percentage points or a reduction of planned free 
cash inflows by up to approximately 50% would not result in any impairment requirement. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the reported 
goodwill in the future.

adidas tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks with indefinite useful lives are impaired 
based on the value-in-use concept on the basis of the relevant cash-generating units. In light of the 
coronavirus pandemic, facts and circumstances indicated that trademarks might be impaired. Due to this 
‘triggering event’, impairment tests at the respective level of cash-generating units were carried on March 
31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020, taking into consideration the expected consequences 
of the coronavirus pandemic. These were based on updated financial planning and estimates. Given the 
unforeseeable future consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, these estimates and judgments are 
subject to an increased level of uncertainty. In order to reflect the increased uncertainty in assessing the 
expected consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, planned free cash inflows were subject to additional 
stress scenarios. In 2020, total impairment losses of € 41 million were recognized for the Reebok 
trademark within the impairment test of June 30, 2020, and therefore the carrying amount amounts to € 
733 million at December 31, 2020. 
The impairment test for the Reebok trademark is performed based on Reebok cash-generating units in the 
individual markets. There has been no change in the methodology compared to 2019. This requires an 
estimate of the recoverable amount of the Reebok groups of cash-generating units to which the Reebok 
brand as a corporate asset is allocated based on planned revenues of the respective Reebok markets. The 
recoverable amount of the respective Reebok markets was determined on the basis of value in use based 
on the present value of the expected future cash flows. The individual Reebok markets are defined as the 
regional markets which are responsible for the distribution of the Reebok brand. The regional Reebok 
markets are Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America and Emerging Markets. The 
number of cash-generating Reebok business units amounted to a total of six at the end of 2020 (2019: six).  
This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a five-year period in 
total. The planning is based on long-term expectations of the company and reflects in total for the Reebok 
markets an average annual mid-single to-low-double-digit sales increase with varying forecast growth 
prospects for the different Reebok markets. Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to expand, 
primarily driven by an improvement in the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a 
percentage of sales. The planning of capital expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past 
experience. The planning for future tax payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the 
individual Reebok markets. Cash flows beyond the detailed planning period of the respective Reebok 
markets are extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 1.7% (2019: 1.7%). According to the company’s 
expectations, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business sector 
in the individual markets in which Reebok operates. 
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average 
market weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for each Reebok 
market. The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the specific equity and country risk of the 
relevant Reebok markets. The respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections of the 
respective cash-generating Reebok business units range from 7.2% to 11.8% (2019: 6.6% to 9.9%).

A change in the discount rate by approximately 0.1 percentage points or a reduction of planned free cash 
inflows by approximately 5% would result in an additional impairment requirement of € 15 million.

018 BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which adidas conducts its business. The largest 
portions of effective gross borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes) as at 
December 31, 2020 are denominated in euro (2020: 98%; 2019: 99%). 
The weighted average interest rate on the Group’s gross borrowings decreased to 1.0% in 2020 (2019: 
1.5%). 
As at December 31, 2020, adidas had cash credit lines and other long-term financing arrangements 
totaling € 7.3 billion (2019: € 3.6 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for € 4.1 billion (2019: 
€ 1.9 billion). In addition, as at December 31, 2020, adidas had separate lines for the issuance of letters of 
credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately € 0.5 billion (2019: € 0.5 billion).  
On November 6, 2020, adidas entered into a new syndicated credit facility agreement with 12 banks 
totaling € 1.5 billion. The credit facility will run until November 2025 and includes two extension options of 
one year each after year 1 and year 2. It can be drawn in euro and further currencies. The interest bearing 
is based on a defined margin on a reference rate (€STR or EURIBOR for euro). This new syndicated loan 
facility transaction replaced the syndicated revolving loan facility under participation of KfW, Germany’s 
state-owned development bank. 
The amounts reported as gross borrowings represent outstanding borrowings under the following 
arrangements with aggregated expiration dates as follows:

In 2020, adidas issued three rated eurobonds with a size of € 500 million and denominations of €100,000 
each. The four-year eurobond maturing on September 9, 2024 with a coupon of 0.00% and the fifteen-year 
eurobond maturing on September 10, 2035 with a coupon of 0.625% were issued on September 1, 2020. 
These bonds were priced with a spread of 33 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively, above the 
corresponding euro mid-swap rate. The issue price was fixed at 100.321% and 99.360%, respectively. In 
adidas’ inaugural sustainability bond issuance on September 29, 2020 an eight-year eurobond was issued 
with a coupon of 0.00% maturing on October 5, 2028. The sustainability bond was priced with a spread of 
40 basis points above the corresponding euro mid-swap rate. The issue price was fixed at 99.410%. 
Proceeds from the issuance will be used in accordance with adidas’ newly created sustainability bond 
framework. Eligible sustainable projects include investments into sustainable materials and processes, as 
well as projects with a positive impact on the community. More specifically, this includes the sourcing of 
recycled materials for sustainably manufactured products, investments into renewable energy production 
and energy-efficient buildings as well as various initiatives aimed at creating lasting change in 
underrepresented communities. 
On September 5, 2018, adidas AG issued a € 500 million equity-neutral convertible bond with a coupon of 
0.05% due on September 12, 2023. The issue price was fixed at 104% of the notional amount, 
corresponding to an annual yield to maturity of negative 0.73%. The initial conversion price was 
determined to be € 291.84, a conversion premium of 40% over the reference share price of € 208.46. The 
economic risk exposure of share price movements was hedged by purchased call options on ordinary 
adidas AG shares.

025 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS  
adidas has recognized post-employment benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans. The 
benefits are provided pursuant to the legal, fiscal and economic conditions in each respective country and 
mainly depend on the employees’ years of service and remuneration.

Defined contribution pension plans  
The total expense for defined contribution pension plans amounted to € 67 million in 2020 (2019: 
€ 74 million). 
Defined benefit pension plans  
Given the company’s diverse subsidiary structure, different defined benefit pension plans exist, comprising 
a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements. The company’s major defined benefit pension plans 
relate to adidas AG and its subsidiaries in the UK and South Korea. The defined benefit pension plans 
generally provide payments in case of death, disability or retirement to former employees and their 
survivors. The obligations arising from defined benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets. 
In Germany, adidas AG grants its employees contribution-based and final salary defined benefit pension 
schemes, which provide employees with entitlements in the event of retirement, disability and death. 
German pension plans operate under the legal framework of the German Company Pensions Act 
(‘Betriebsrentengesetz’) and under general German labor legislation. From 2020 onwards, active existing 
employees and new entrants are entitled to benefits in accordance with the general company agreement 
‘Core Benefits: adidas company pension plan’. This is a pension plan with a basic employer contribution, 
possible salary sacrifices and additional matching contribution. Thus, the contributions to this pension 
plan are partly paid by the employee and partly paid by the employer. The contributions are transferred 
into benefit components. The benefits are paid out in the form of a pension, a lump sum or installments. 
The pension plans in Germany are financed using book reserves, a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) 
and, for certain former members of the Executive Board of adidas AG, a pension fund (‘Pensionsfonds’) in 
combination with a reinsured provident fund (‘Unterstützungskasse’). Further details about the pension 
entitlements of members of the Executive Board of adidas AG are provided in this Annual Report. 
► SEE 
COMPENSATION REPORT
 
The final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is closed to new entrants and to future accrual. 
The benefits are mainly paid out in the form of pensions. The scheme operates under UK trust law as well 
as under the jurisdiction of the UK Pensions Regulator and therefore is subject to a minimum funding 
requirement. The Trustee Board is responsible for setting the scheme’s funding objective, agreeing the 
contributions with the company and determining the investment strategy of the scheme.  
In South Korea, adidas grants a final salary defined pension plan to certain employees. This plan is open to 
new entrants. The benefits are paid out in the form of a lump sum. The pension plan operates under the 
Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act (ERSA). This regulation requires a minimum funding amounting 
to 90% of the present value of the vested benefit obligation. The annual contribution includes at least the 
minimum amount in order to meet the funding requirements.

The Group’s pension plans are subject to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the 
discount rate, salary and pension increase rates, and risks from changes in mortality. A lower discount 
rate results in a higher defined benefit obligation and/or in higher contributions to the pension funds. 
Lower than expected performance of the plan assets could lead to an increase in required contributions or 
to a decline of the funded status.

pension plans, expenses recognized in the consolidated income statement, actuarial assumptions and

The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans is based upon actuarial valuations. In 
particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial variables (such as the 
discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee 
turnover). The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual circumstances and could lead 
to different cash flows.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
The weighted average actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to determine the 
defined benefit liability at that date and the pension expense for the upcoming financial year. 
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are based on statistical information available 
in the various countries. In Germany, the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables are used. In the UK, 
assumptions are based on the S3 base tables with modified improvement of the life expectancy mortality 
tables. In South Korea, the KIDI 2019 tables from the Korea Insurance Development Institute are used. 
As in the previous year, the calculation of the pension liabilities in Germany is based on a discount rate 
determined using the ‘Mercer Yield Curve (MYC)’ approach. 
Remeasurements, such as gains or losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions for defined 
benefit pension plans or a return on the plan assets exceeding the interest income, are immediately 
recognized outside the income statement as a change in other reserves in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.

South Korea. In addition, the average duration of the obligation is shown.

Since many pension plans are closed to future accrual, the salary trend plays a minor role in determining 
pension obligations. Due to the fact that with the introduction of the Core Benefits arrangement, German 
pension plans are mainly paid as lump sums, the pension increase rate and the mortality assumption have 
significantly less impact than the discount rate when calculating the pension obligations.

Approximately 96% (2019: 96%) of the total plan assets are allocated to plan assets in the three major 
countries: Germany (2020: 79%, 2019: 78%), UK (2020: 13%, 2019: 13%) and South Korea (2020: 5%, 2019: 
5%).  
Part of the plan assets in Germany is held by a trustee under a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) for 
the purpose of funding the pension obligations of adidas AG and insolvency insurance with regard to part of 
the pension obligations of adidas AG. The trustee is the registered association adidas Pension Trust e.V. 
The investment committee of the adidas Pension Trust determines the investment strategy with the goal to 
match the pension liabilities as far as possible and to generate a sustainable return. In 2020, no additional 
employer funding contribution was transferred to the trustee. The plan assets in the registered 
association are mainly invested in real estate, cash and cash equivalents, equity index funds and hybrid 
bonds. Another part of the plan assets in Germany is invested in insurance contracts via a pension fund 
and a provident fund. For this portion, an insurance entity is responsible for the determination and the 
implementation of the investment strategy. 
In the UK, the plan assets are held in an external trust. The investment strategy is aligned with the 
structure of the pension obligations in these countries. In the rest of the world, the plan assets consist 
predominantly of insurance contracts. 
The expected payments for the 2021 financial year amount to € 19 million. Thereof, € 13 million relate to 
benefits directly paid to pensioners by the subsidiaries and € 6 million to employer contributions paid into 
the plan assets. In 2020, the actual return on plan assets (including interest income) was € 19 million 
(2019: return on plan assets of € 28 million).

027 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY  
The nominal capital of adidas AG has remained unchanged since December 31, 2019. As at the balance 
sheet date, it amounted to a total of € 200,416,186 divided into 200,416,186 registered no-par-value shares 
and was fully paid in.  
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting from the commencement of the year in 
which it was issued. Treasury shares held directly or indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in 
accordance with § 71b German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG). As at the balance sheet date, 
adidas AG held 5,350,126 treasury shares, corresponding to a notional amount of € 5,350,126 in nominal 
capital and consequently to 2.67% of the nominal capital. 
Authorized Capital 
The Executive Board of adidas AG did not utilize the existing amount of authorized capital of up to 
€ 90 million in the 2020 financial year. 
The authorized capital of adidas AG, which is set out in § 4 sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Articles of 
Association on the balance sheet date, entitles the Executive Board, subject to Supervisory Board approval, 
to increase the nominal capital based on the following authorizations: 
Based on the authorization granted by the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2017 until 
June 7 , 2022: 
─ by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than € 50 million 
and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude residual amounts from shareholders’ 
subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2017/I); 
Based on the authorization granted by the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 9, 2019 until 
June 13, 2024: 
─ by issuing new shares against contributions in kind once or several times by no more than € 16 million 
and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights (Authorized

The overall volume of the shares issued based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription 
rights must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the point in time when this authorization 
becomes effective or, where this amount is lower, at the date of the respective issuance. The nominal

conversion obligations from bonds, debt securities, or participation rights to the extent that they are

of 10%. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from 
subscription rights. The Authorized Capital 2019 must not be used to issue shares within the scope of 
compensation or participation programs for Executive Board members, employees, members of the

as possible to the placement of the shares; this exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated 
with the listing of the adidas AG shares on a foreign stock exchange (Authorized Capital 2017/III). The 
authorization to exclude subscription rights pursuant to the previous sentence may, however, only be 
used to the extent that the pro rata amount of the new shares in the nominal capital together with the 
pro rata amount in the nominal capital of other shares which have been issued by adidas AG since 
May 11, 2017, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to or in accordance with § 186

2016). Shareholders’ subscription rights shall be excluded. Any repurchased treasury shares of 
adidas AG which are used by adidas AG for employee stock purchase plans during the term of this 
authorization shall be attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. The new shares may 
only be issued to (current and former) employees of adidas AG and its affiliated companies as well as

Contingent Capital 
The following overview of the Contingent Capital is based on § 4 section 6 of the Articles of Association of 
adidas AG as well as on the underlying resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 9, 2018. 
Additional contingent capital does not exist. 
Contingent Capital 2018 
The nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to € 12.5 million divided into not more than 12,500,000 
registered no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital 2018). The contingent capital increase serves the 
issuance of registered no-par-value shares when exercising option or conversion rights, fulfilling the 
respective option and/or conversion obligations, or when exercising the company’s right to choose to 
partially or fully deliver registered no-par-value shares of the company instead of paying the due amount 
to the holders or creditors of bonds issued by the company, or a subordinated Group company up to 
May 8, 2023 on the basis of the authorization resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 
May 9, 2018. The new shares will be issued at the respective option or conversion price to be established in 
accordance with the aforementioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase will be 
implemented only to the extent that holders or creditors of option or conversion rights, or the persons 
obligated to exercise the option or conversion obligations based on bonds issued by the company, or a 
subordinated Group company, pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board granted by the 
resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018 (Agenda Item 8), up to May 8, 2023 and 
guaranteed by the company, exercise their option or conversion rights or, if they are obligated to exercise 
the option or conversion obligations, fulfill their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the bond, or 
to the extent that the company exercises its rights to choose to deliver adidas AG shares for the total 
amount or a part amount instead of payment of the amount due and insofar as no cash settlement, 
treasury shares or shares of another public listed company are used to service these rights. The new 
shares will carry dividend rights from the commencement of the financial year in which the shares are 
issued. The Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to stipulate any 
additional details concerning the implementation of the contingent capital increase. 
The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders’ 
subscription rights for residual amounts and to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights insofar as this is 
necessary for granting subscription rights to which holders or creditors of previously issued bonds are 
entitled. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude 
shareholders’ subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical 
market value of these bonds and the number of shares to be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal 
capital. Treasury shares which are or will be sold with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance 
with § 71 section 1 no. 8 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between the starting date of 
the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds are attributed to the 
aforementioned limit of 10%. Shares which are or will be issued, subject to the exclusion of subscription 
rights pursuant to § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG or pursuant to § 203 section 1 in conjunction with § 186 
section 3 sentence 4 AktG, between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of 
the respective bonds in the context of a cash capital increase are also attributed to the aforementioned 
limit of 10%. Finally, shares for which there are option or conversion rights or obligations or a right to 
delivery of shares of the company in favor of the company due to bonds with warrants or convertible bonds 
issued by adidas AG or its subordinated Group companies, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights in 
accordance with § 221 section 4 sentence 2 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG during the 
term of this authorization based on other authorizations are attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. 
In the period up until the balance sheet date, the Executive Board of adidas AG did not issue any bonds 
based on the authorization granted on May 9, 2018 and consequently did not issue any shares from the 
Contingent Capital 2018.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Repurchase of adidas AG shares and use of treasury shares 
The Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016 granted the Executive Board an authorization to repurchase 
adidas AG shares up to an amount totaling 10% of the nominal capital until May 11, 2021. The authorization 
may be used by adidas AG, by its subordinated Group companies, by third parties on behalf of adidas AG or 
its subordinated Group companies, or third parties assigned by adidas AG or one of its subordinated Group 
companies. 
Based on the above-mentioned authorization, the Executive Board of adidas AG commenced a share 
buyback program on March 22, 2018. Under the authorization granted, adidas AG repurchased a total of 
3,223,214 shares for a total price of € 814,826,285 (excluding incidental purchasing costs), i.e. for an 
average price of € 252.80 per share, in a second tranche between January 1, 2019 and December 18, 2019 
inclusive. This corresponded to a notional amount of € 3,223,214 in the nominal capital and consequently 
to 1.61% of the nominal capital. The sharebuy back program was resumed on January 7, 2020, in the form 
of a third tranche which was terminated on March 16, 2020. More information on the adidas AG shares 
repurchased in the 2020 financial year, is set out in the table ‘Repurchase of adidas AG shares in the 2020 
financial year’. 
While the company may use the repurchased shares for all purposes admissible under the authorization 
granted on May 12, 2016 with the exception of the transfer of shares as a compensation component for its 
Executive Board members, adidas AG plans to cancel the majority of the repurchased shares. adidas AG 
reserves the right to continue the share buyback program in the future in alignment with the published 
parameters.
 ► SEE DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO § 315A SECTION 1 AND § 289A SECTION 1 OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE AND 
EXPLANATORY REPORT  
In the 2020 financial year, a total of 49,691 treasury shares were used as consideration for, inter alia, the 
transfer or licensing of intellectual property rights and intangible property rights due to contractual 
obligations. Due to the use of treasury shares with the exclusion of subscription rights, adidas AG was able 
to acquire the intellectual and intangible property rights (or licenses) from their owner at attractive terms 
while preserving the company’s liquidity. Based on the share price at the time of transfer, the 
49,691 treasury shares had a value of altogether approx. € 14 million, corresponding to a notional amount 
of € 49,691 in the nominal capital and consequently to 0.02% of the nominal capital.

Capital management 
The company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. 
adidas seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be possible with higher 
levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The company 
further aims to maintain adjusted net borrowings below two times EBITDA over the long term. adidas 
intends to maintain a continuous rating in the middle of the upper rating class (S&P: A and Moody's: A2). In 
August, adidas was rated 'A +' by Standard & Poor's and 'A2' by Moody’s for the first time. The outlook for 
both ratings is stable.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Financial leverage amounts to 48.8% (2019: 61.4%) and is defined as the ratio between adjusted net 
borrowings in an amount of € 3.148 billion (2019: € 4.173 billion) and shareholders’ equity in an amount of 
€ 6 .454 billion (2019: € 6.796 billion). EBITDA amounted to € 2.079 billion for the financial year ending 
December 31, 2020 (2019: €  3.845 billion). The ratio between adjusted net borrowings and EBITDA 
amounted to 1.5 for the 2020 financial year (2019: 1.1). 
In 2020, the definition of the ratio net borrowings over EBITDA was changed to adjusted net borrowings over 
EBITDA to reflect changes in the company’s Financial Policy. The most significant difference between the previous 
net borrowings definition and the new adjusted net borrowings definition is the inclusion of the present value of 
future lease and pension liabilities. Prior year figures are restated. 
Reserves  
Reserves within shareholders’ equity are as follows: 
─ Capital reserve: primarily comprises the paid premium for the issuance of share capital as well as the 
equity component of the issued convertible bond. 
─ Cumulative currency translation differences: comprises all foreign currency differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. 
─ Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash 
flow hedges (intrinsic value for options and spot component for forward contracts) related to hedged 
transactions that have not yet occurred, hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as 
the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the total return swap. 
─ Cost of hedging reserve – options: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the 
fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of options (time value and premium). 
─ Cost of hedging reserve – forward contracts: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net 
change in the fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of forward contracts (forward 
component). 
─ Other reserves: comprises the remeasurements of defined benefit plans consisting of the cumulative 
net change of actuarial gains or losses relating to the defined benefit obligations, the return on plan 
assets (excluding interest income) and the asset ceiling effect, the remeasurement of the fair value of 
the equity investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, expenses 
recognized for share option plans, effects from the acquisition of non-controlling interests, as well as 
reserves required by law. 
─ Retained earnings: comprises both amounts which are required by the Articles of Association and 
voluntary amounts that have been set aside by adidas. The reserve includes the unappropriated 
accumulated profits less dividends paid, and consideration paid for the repurchase of adidas AG shares 
exceeding the nominal value. In addition, the item includes the effects of the employee stock purchase 
plan and the transition effects of the implementation of new IFRSs.

028 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees  
In 2016, adidas announced the introduction of an open-ended employee stock purchase plan (the ‘plan’). 
The plan is operated on a quarterly basis, with each calendar quarter referred to as an ‘investment 
quarter’. 
The plan enables employees to purchase adidas AG shares with a 15% discount (‘investment shares’) and 
to benefit from free matching shares. Currently, eligible employees of adidas AG and seventeen other 
subsidiaries can participate in the plan. Up to two weeks before the start of an investment quarter each 
eligible employee can enroll for the plan. The company accepts enrolment requests on the first day of the 
relevant investment quarter. This is the grant date for the investment and matching shares. The fair value 
at the vesting date is equivalent to the fair value of the granted equity instruments at this date. The 
employees invest an amount up to 10% of their gross base salary per quarter in the plan. A few days after 
the end of the investment quarter the shares are purchased on the market at fair market value and 
transferred to the employees. Thereby the amount invested during the quarter plus the top-up from adidas 
is used. These shares can be sold at any time by the employee. If the shares are held for a period of one 
year after the last day of an investment quarter, employees will receive, as a one-off, free matching shares 
(one matching share for every six adidas AG shares acquired). This plan currently constitutes an equity-
settled share-based payment for both elements. For the component of the matching shares relating to the 
specific period of service an appropriate discount is taken into account. The effects are presented in the 
following table:

Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties 
In 2016, adidas entered into a promotion and advertising contract which includes a share-based payment 
transaction with third parties. The contract has a duration of five years and will end in 2022. 
The first part of the agreement grants a transfer of basic shares over five years which correspond to a 
value of US $ 5million each year. Based on the contractual terms, the fourth transfer in 2020 equated to 
16,520 shares. The fifth granting for 2021 was transferred in 2020 and equated to 15,764 shares. The 
shares from the fifth tranche of repurchased shares with an average price of € 198.91 per share were 
used as a consideration.
 ► SEE NOTE 27 
As at January 1, 2020 (grant date), an amount of US $ 5 million was recognized as expenses for basic 
shares over the vesting period of twelve months. 
The second part of the agreement grants bonus shares of US $ 5 million if certain conditions are fulfilled. 
This option can be granted twice. In 2020 the first bonus shares were granted, hence 17,407 shares were 
transferred. The shares from the fifth tranche of repurchased shares with an average price of € 198.91 per 
share were used as a consideration. As at December 31, 2020, it was likely that the second bonus shares 
will be issued. Therefore, the accrual amounting to € 4 million for the second bonus shares was kept in 
2020 (2019: € 4 million). 
Cash-settled share-based payment transactions with employees 
In 2017, adidas implemented a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan, which is a share-based remuneration 
scheme with cash settlement. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) are granted on the condition that the 
beneficiary is employed for three or four years by adidas AG or one of its subsidiaries in a position where 
he or she is not under notice during that period. This minimum period of employment pertains to the 
calendar year in which the RSUs are granted and the three subsequent calendar years. 
The total value of the cash remuneration payable to senior management is recalculated on each reporting 
date and on the settlement date, based on the fair value of the RSUs, and recognized through an 
appropriate increase in the provision as personnel expenses that are spread over the period of service of 
the beneficiary. Furthermore, social security contributions are considered in the calculation of the fair 
value, if appropriate for the respective country regulations and the seniority of the participants. All 
changes to the subsequent measurement of this provision are reported under personnel expenses. 
Once a year, one tranche with a three-year term and another with a four-year term are issued. The 
number of RSUs granted depends on the seniority of the beneficiaries. In addition, for the four-year plan, 
the number of RSUs also depends on the achievement of a target figure which is based on the growth of 
the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. 
The value of one RSU is the average price of the adidas AG share as quoted for the first 20 stock exchange 
trading days in January of the respective financial year. The effects are presented in the following table:

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial assets, accounts 
receivable and payable as well as other current financial receivables and payables, their respective fair 
values equal their carrying amount.  
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future 
cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities and adjusted by 
a company-specific credit risk premium. 
Fair values of long-term financial assets are based on quoted market prices in an active market or are 
calculated as present values of expected future cash flows. 
adidas designated certain investments as equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (equity), because the company intends to hold those investments for the long term in order to gain 
insights into innovative production technologies and trends. The designation of certain equity instruments 
at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is based on a strategic Management decision. 
In accordance with IFRS 13, the following tables show the valuation methods used in measuring Level 1,

FINANCIAL RISKS 
 
Currency risks 
Currency risks for adidas are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the company. The vast 
majority of the transactional risk arises from product sourcing in US dollars, while sales are typically 
denominated in the functional currency of the respective companies. The currencies in which these 
transactions are mainly denominated are the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese 
renminbi.  
As governed by the company’s Treasury Policy, adidas has established a hedging system on a rolling basis 
up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is 
secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In rare instances, hedges are contracted 
beyond the 24-month horizon. 
adidas uses a combination of different hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, 
currency options, and swaps, to protect itself against unfavorable currency movements. These contracts 
are generally designated as cash flow hedges.  
Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the 
company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on the company’s 
financial performance. 
Further information about the accounting and hedge accounting treatment is included in these Notes.

Net exposure  (1,709)  71  129  126 
 
The exposure from firm commitments and forecast transactions was calculated on a one-year basis. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, the company has calculated the impact on net income and shareholders’ 
equity based on changes in the most important currency exchange rates. The calculated impacts mainly 
result from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. The analysis does not include effects that 
arise from the translation of the company’s foreign entities’ financial statements into the company’s 
reporting currency, the euro. The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet exposure, including 
intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Moreover, 
all outstanding currency derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates to 
determine the effects on net income and equity. The analysis was performed on the same basis for both 
2020 and 2019. 
Based on this analysis, a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar at December 31, 2020 would have 
led to a € 6  million increase in net income.

The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges would have decreased shareholders’ equity by 
€ 379 million. A 10% weaker euro at December 31, 2020 would have led to a € 11 million decrease in net 
income. Shareholders’ equity would have increased by € 478 million. The impacts of fluctuations of the 
euro against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi on net income and 
shareholders’ equity are also included in accordance with IFRS requirements.  
However, many other financial and operational variables that could potentially reduce the effect of 
currency fluctuations are excluded from the analysis. For instance: 
─ Interest rates, commodity prices and all other exchange rates are assumed constant. 
─ Exchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead of the more relevant sales-weighted average 
figure, which the company utilizes internally to better reflect both the seasonality of its business and 
intra-year currency fluctuations. 
─ The underlying forecast cash flow exposure (which the hedge instrument mainly relates to) is not 
required to be revalued in this analysis. 
─ Operational issues, such as potential discounts for key accounts, which have high transparency 
regarding the impacts of currency on our sourcing activities (due to their own private label sourcing 
efforts), are also excluded from this analysis. 
─ The credit risk is not considered as part of this analysis. 
The company also largely hedges balance sheet risks. Due to its strong global position, adidas is able to 
partly minimize the currency risk by utilizing natural hedges. The company’s gross US dollar cash flow 
exposure calculated for 2021 was around € 6.1 billion at year-end 2020, which was hedged using forward 
exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Credit risks 
A credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. adidas is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain 
financing activities. Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, from 
other third-party contractual financial obligations such as other financial assets, short-term bank deposits 
and derivative financial instruments. Without taking into account any collateral or other credit 
enhancements, the carrying amount of financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum 
exposure to credit risk. 
At the end of 2020, there was no relevant concentration of credit risk by type of customer or geography. 
The company’s credit risk exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics. Under the 
company’s credit policy, new customers are analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and 
delivery terms and conditions are offered. Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for 
each customer. Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Customers that fail to meet the company’s minimum creditworthiness are, in general, allowed to purchase 
products only on a prepayment basis. 
Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses as well as, on a selective basis, 
credit insurance, the sale of accounts receivable without recourse, and bank guarantees. Further 
quantitative information on the extent to which credit enhancements mitigate the credit risk of accounts 
receivable is included in these Notes.
 ► SEE NOTE 07 
At the end of 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. 
The Treasury department arranges currency, commodity interest rate and equity hedges, and invests cash 
with major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world. adidas subsidiaries are authorized to 
work with banks rated BBB+ or higher. Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorized to work with 
banks rated lower than BBB+. To limit risk in these cases, restrictions are clearly stipulated, such as 
maximum cash deposit levels. In addition, the credit default swap premiums of the company’s partner 
banks are monitored on a monthly basis. In the event that the defined threshold is exceeded, credit 
balances are shifted to banks compliant with the limit.
 ► SEE TREASURY 
adidas furthermore believes that the risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of the 
investment business of the company with more than 20 globally operating banks. At December 31, 2020, 
no bank accounted for more than 10% of the investments of adidas. Including subsidiaries’ short-term 
deposits in local banks, the average concentration was 2%. This leads to a maximum exposure of 
€ 225 million in the event of default of any single bank. The investment exposure was further diversified by 
investing into AAA-rated money market funds. 
In addition, in 2020, adidas held derivatives of foreign exchange with a positive fair market value in the 
amount of € 129 million. The maximum exposure to any single bank resulting from these assets amounted 
to € 42 million and the average concentration was 8%. 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the following table includes further information about set-off possibilities of 
derivative financial assets and liabilities. The majority of agreements between financial institutions and 
adidas include a mutual right to set off. However, these agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting 
in the statement of financial position, because the right to set off is enforceable only in the event of 
counterparty defaults. 
The carrying amounts of recognized derivative financial instruments, which are subject to the agreements 
mentioned here, are also presented in the following table:

Interest rate risks 
Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments for variable-interest liabilities. As 
adidas does not have material variable-interest liabilities, even a significant increase in interest rates 
should have only slight adverse effects on the company’s profitability, liquidity, and financial position. 
To reduce interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility, a core tenet of the company’s financial 
strategy is to continue to use surplus cash flow from operations to reduce short-term gross borrowings. 
Beyond that, adidas may consider adequate hedging strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to 
mitigate interest rate risks.
 ► SEE TREASURY 
Share price risks 
Share price risks arise due to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration 
scheme with cash settlement, and the equity-neutral convertible bond with cash settlement. In order to 
mitigate share price risks, it is company strategy to use swaps and options to hedge against share price 
fluctuations. Swaps are used to hedge the Long-Term Incentive Plan and are classified as cash flow 
hedges. The embedded cash option in the convertible bond is fully offset with a call option to mitigate the 
cash settlement. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, adidas has calculated the impact on net income based on changes in the 
company’s share price. A 10% increase in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price at 
December 31, 2020 would have led to a € 19 million increase in net income and a € 9 million increase in 
shareholders’ equity. Whereas a 10% decrease in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price 
at December 31, 2020 would only have led to a € 19 million decrease in net income and would have 
decreased shareholders’ equity by € 9 million. 
Financing and liquidity risks 
Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available to meet maturing liabilities with 
regard to timing, volume and currency structure. In addition, the company faces the risk of having to 
accept unfavorable financing terms due to liquidity restraints. The Treasury department uses an efficient 
cash management system to manage liquidity risk. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents 
together with marketable securities amounted to € 3.994 billion (2019: € 2.511 billion). Moreover, the

ensure sufficient liquidity at all times. On November 6, 2020 adidas entered into a new € 1.5 billion 
syndicated credit facility with twelve of its partner banks. This new syndicated credit facility replaced the 
syndicated loan facility under participation of KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank. The 
company had received the approval from the German government for the participation of KfW in the total 
€ 3.0 billion syndicated loan credit in April 2020 to bridge the unprecedented situation caused by the global

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
In 2020, the definition of the ratio net borrowings over EBITDA was changed to adjusted net borrowings 
over EBITDA to reflect changes in the company’s Financial Policy. The most significant difference between 
the previous net borrowings definition and the new adjusted net borrowings definition is the inclusion of 
the present value of future lease and pension liabilities.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a material amount of initial planned exposure for purchases and sales in 
foreign currencies ceased to exist, which led to certain over-hedge positions. In accordance with IFRS 9, 
hedge accounting was immediately discontinued for hedging instruments that were no longer covered by a 
purchase or sales transaction, and, at the time the over-hedged status was determined, the fair value was 
transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement. 
In 2020, a profit of € 29 million was reclassified into the income statement. 
In addition, hedging instruments not designated as hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 were 
canceled to minimize the economic risk. 
The following table provides a reconciliation by risk category of components of equity and analysis of OCI 
items, net of tax, resulting from cash flow hedge accounting.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
035 HYPERINFLATION 
Due to the rapid devaluation of the Argentinian peso, Argentina is considered as hyperinflationary and as a 
result the application of IAS 29 was adopted for the first time in the third quarter of 2018. The financial 
statements of 2018 for those subsidiaries that have the Argentinian peso as a functional currency had been 
restated for the change in the general purchasing power retrospectively since January 1, 2018. The 
financial statements are based on a historical cost approach. The prior year figures are stated in terms of 
the measuring unit current at December 31, 2019.  
For translation into the presentation currency (euro), all amounts were translated at the closing rate at 
December 31, 2020. The net assets in the subsidiary’s local financial statements were adjusted for 
changes in the price level. 
The price index at December 31, 2020 was 5,125.55 (2019: 3,767.12). 
036 INCOME TAXES  
adidas AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to German corporate and trade taxes. For the years 
ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, the statutory corporate income tax rate of 15% plus a surcharge of 
5.5% thereon is applied to earnings. The municipal trade tax is approximately 11.4% of taxable income. 
For non-German subsidiaries, deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the closing date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if:   
- the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; 
and  
- the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either: 
-  the same taxable entity; or  
- different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a 
net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future 
period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be 
settled or recovered. 
 
The following deferred tax assets and liabilities, determined after appropriate offsetting, are presented in 
the consolidated statement of financial position:

Liabilities and provisions  20  82 
Deferred tax liabilities  830  1,039 
Deferred tax assets, net  992  813 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit is probable. 
For the assessment of probability, in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the 
foreseeable future, appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into consideration. 
Deferred tax assets for which the realization of the related tax benefits is not probable decreased from 
€ 488 million to € 386 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. These amounts mainly relate to tax 
losses carried forward and unused tax credits of the US tax group, which begin to expire in 2028. The 
remaining unrecognized deferred tax assets relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where the 
realization of the related tax benefit is not considered probable. 
adidas does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German subsidiaries to 
the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings, 
the amount of which cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were 
remitted as dividends or if the company were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
038 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION 
adidas operates predominantly in one industry segment – the design, distribution and marketing of athletic 
and sports lifestyle products. 
As at December 31, 2020, following the company’s internal management reporting by markets and in 
accordance with the definition of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments,’ ten operating segments were identified: 
Europe, adidas North America, Reebok North America, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America, Emerging 
Markets, adidas Golf, Runtastic and Other centrally managed businesses. 
The operating segments adidas North America and Reebok North America have been aggregated to the 
segment North America. 
According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for reportable segments, the operating segments Europe, North 
America, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America and Emerging Markets are reported separately. The 
remaining operating segments are aggregated under Other Businesses due to their only subordinate 
materiality.  
Each market comprises all wholesale, retail and e-commerce business activities relating to the 
distribution and sale of products of the adidas and Reebok brands to retail customers and end consumers. 
adidas Golf comprises the distribution and sale of adidas Golf branded products. 
Runtastic operates in the digital health and fitness space. The company provides a comprehensive 
ecosystem for tracking and managing health and fitness data. 
Other centrally managed businesses primarily include the business activities of the Y-3 label. 
Certain centralized corporate functions do not meet the definition of IFRS 8 for an operating segment. This 
includes, in particular, functions such as Global Brands and Global Sales (central brand and distribution 
management for the adidas and Reebok brands), central treasury, global sourcing as well as other 
headquarter functions. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses relating to these corporate functions are 
presented in the reconciliations. 
The chief operating decision maker for adidas has been defined as the entire Executive Board of adidas AG. 
Net sales represent revenue from contracts with customers. There are no intersegment sales between the 
reportable segments. Accounting and valuation policies applied for reporting segmental information are 
the same as those used for adidas.
 ► SEE NOTE 02 
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item ‘Segmental operating profit.’ This is 
defined as gross profit minus other operating expenses plus royalty and commission income and other 
operating income attributable to the segment or group of segments, without considering headquarter 
costs and central expenditure for marketing. 
Segmental assets include accounts receivable as well as inventories. Only these items are reported to the 
chief operating decision maker on a regular basis. Depreciation, amortization, impairment losses (except 
for goodwill) and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditure for tangible and intangible 
assets are part of the segmental reporting, even though segmental assets do not contain tangible and

intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization as well as impairment losses and reversals of 
impairment losses not directly attributable to a segment or a group of segments are presented under line 
items ‘HQ’ and ‘Consolidation’ in the reconciliations. 
Segmental liabilities only contain accounts payable from operating activities as there are no other liability 
items reported regularly to the chief operating decision maker. 
Interest income and interest expenses as well as income taxes are not allocated to the reportable 
segments and are not reported separately to the chief operating decision maker.

039 ADDITIONAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
In 2020, net cash used in operating activities compared to the prior year results was primarily due to a 
decrease in income before taxes and a decrease in operating working capital requirements which was 
partly offset by a decrease in income taxes paid.  
The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 mainly results from a decrease in spending on 
property, plant, and equipment such as investments in the furnishing and fitting of adidas’ own-retail 
stores, in new office buildings and IT systems and from proceeds from sale of short-term financial assets.  
Net cash generated from financing activities mainly related to the issuance of three new eurobonds and 
the proceeds from short-term borrowings including the short-term borrowing of the syndicated loan from 
the KfW bank. In comparison to prior year the not paid out dividends to shareholders of adidas AG and the 
stopping of the repurchase of adidas AG shares leads to a higher net cash generated from financing 
activities compared to net cash used in the prior year. In contrast are the repayments of lease liabilities 
and the repayment of the pay back for the syndicated loan from the KfW bank.

Litigation and other legal risks 
The company is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the normal course of business, 
mainly in connection with distribution agreements as well as intellectual property rights. The risks 
regarding these lawsuits are covered by provisions when a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made.
 In the opinion of Management, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims 
will not materially affect the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group.
 ► SEE NOTE 20 
The company is in dispute with the local revenue authorities in South Africa (SARS) with regard to the 
customs value of imported products. In June 2018, SARS issued a ruling claiming a customs payment 
including interest and penalties for the years 2007 to 2013 in an amount of ZAR 1,871 million 
(€ 104 million). adidas has applied for a suspension of the payment demand and in 2019 instituted legal 
action against the decision before the High Court in South Africa. In case the court rules in favor of SARS, 
adidas will appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court of South Africa. Based on external legal 
opinions, Management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the claim made by SARS will 
eventually not result in an outflow of resources. Therefore, a provision was not recognized in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. 
In connection with the financial irregularities at Reebok India Company in 2012, various legal uncertainties 
were identified. The respective remaining risks cannot be assessed conclusively. However, based on legal 
opinions and internal assessments, Management assumes that the effects will not have any material 
influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company. 
In October 2018, a former employee of the company’s US subsidiary was convicted of wire fraud in 
connection with unauthorized payments to certain college basketball players or their families during the 
former employee’s time at the US subsidiary. The company’s US subsidiary, with the full support of the 
company, has cooperated and continues to cooperate with the prosecutors, including by conducting an 
internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel. While Management currently believes that

the actions of its former employee will not have any material influence on the assets, liabilities, financial

Information pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) 
In December 2020, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued an updated Declaration 
of Compliance in accordance with § 161 AktG and made it permanently available to the shareholders. The 
full text of the Declaration of Compliance is available on the company’s corporate website. 
044 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE 
In order to be able to successfully execute our new strategy ‘Own the Game’ for the period until 2025, 
adidas has changed its organizational structure. Since January 1, 2021, adidas manages Greater China as 
a separate market and integrated Russia/CIS and Emerging Markets into the European market. The 
markets North America and Latin America remain unchanged. Due to a change in the composition of the 
operating segments and associated cash-generating units respectively, adidas performed a reallocation of 
the carrying amounts of goodwill and an impairment test of the goodwill as of January 1, 2021. In this 
context, there was no need for impairment. 
As part of the development of its new five-year strategy, adidas has concluded its assessment of strategic 
alternatives for Reebok. As a result of this review in February 2021, the company has decided to begin a 
process aimed at divesting Reebok. Accordingly, adidas is going to report the Reebok business as 
discontinued operations from the first quarter 2021 onward.  
Immediately before the reclassification to discontinued operations, an impairment test according to IAS 36 
was conducted and no impairment or write-up was required. On the initial classification as discontinued 
operations, the measurement at fair value also did not lead to an impairment.  
The following table indicates the impact on the major line items in the consolidated income statement for 
the year 2020 under the assumption that the Reebok business activities had been represented as 
discontinued operations on January 1, 2020.

REPRODUCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR'S REPORT
 
Based on the results of our audit, we have issued the following unqualified audit opinion: 
 
Independent Auditor's Report 
 
To adidas AG, Herzogenaurach 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Opinions 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, and its subsidiaries 
(hereinafter 'adidas' or the 'Group'), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 
December 31, 2020, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for 
the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the 
combined management report ('group management report') of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. In accordance with German legal requirements, we 
have not audited the content of those components of the group management report specified in the ‘Other 
Information’ section of our auditor's report. 
The group management report contains cross-references that are not required by law and which are 
marked as unaudited. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the cross-
references and the information to which the cross-references refer. 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
─ the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to 
Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these 
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of 
December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2020, and  
─ the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's 
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not 
cover the content of those components of the group management report specified in the ‘Other 
Information’ section of the auditor's report. The group management report contains cross-references 
that are not required by law and which are marked as unaudited. Our audit opinion does not extend to 
the cross-references and the information to which the cross-references refer.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
296 
    
    
ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations 
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report. 
Basis for the opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and EU Audit Regulation No. 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as ‘EU 
Audit Regulation’) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). 
Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the ‘Auditor's 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management 
Report’ section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our 
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in 
accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-
audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.  
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. 
Key audit matters in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Impairment testing of the Reebok brand 
For the accounting policies used and the disclosures on the judgments applied by the Executive Board and 
sources of estimation uncertainties please refer to Note 2 and for the disclosures on the measurement of 
the Reebok brand please refer to Note 14 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The financial statement risk 
The Reebok brand was recognized as of December 31, 2020, in the amount of € 733 million. 
The Reebok brand is to be tested for impairment at least once a year. To this end, the brand is allocated as 
a ‘corporate asset’ pursuant to IAS 36 to the cash-generating Reebok business units at the level of the 
markets and the value in use of these cash-generating units is compared with the carrying amount of 
these units. The valuation model used to determine the value in use is complex; the result of this valuation 
is heavily dependent on the estimate of future net cash flows (taking into account future revenue growth, 
profit margins, exchange rates and long-term growth rates) and the discount factor used, and is thus 
subject to considerable uncertainty. 
There is the risk for the financial statements that any existing impairment of the Reebok brand as of the 
reporting date was not identified or that a required reversal of an impairment loss on the brand was not 
carried out. 
Our audit approach 
With the involvement of our valuation experts, we assessed the appropriateness of the key assumptions 
and calculation methods of the Company, among other things. For this purpose, we discussed the

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
expected business and earnings development at the level of the cash-generating Reebok business units to 
which the brand as corporate asset is allocated and the assumed long-term growth rates with those 
responsible for planning. Furthermore, we carried out comparisons with other internally available 
forecasts, e.g. the budget planning for a period of five years prepared by the Executive Board. In addition, 
we evaluated the consistency of the growth rates used in the budget planning using external market 
assessments. 
We also confirmed the accuracy of the Company's previous forecasts by comparing the budgets of 
previous financial years with actual results and by analyzing deviations. Since even minor changes to the 
discount rate can have a material effect on the results of impairment testing, we compared the 
assumptions and data underlying the discount rate, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk 
premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and publicly available data.  
To ensure the computational accuracy of the valuation model used, we verified the Company's calculations 
on the basis of selected risk-based elements. 
In order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the impact of potential changes in the 
discount rate, earnings performance and long-term growth rate on the value in use (sensitivity analysis) by 
calculating alternative scenarios and comparing these with the values stated by the Company. In addition, 
we verified the plausibility of the Company's calculations with alternative valuation considerations and 
data. 
Our observations 
The calculation method used for impairment testing of the Reebok brand is appropriate and in line with the 
accounting policies to be applied. The assumptions and data used by the Executive Board are balanced 
overall. 
Accurate recording and assessment of the covid-19-induced changes to leases in 
accordance with IFRS 16 
For the accounting policies used, please refer to Note 2 and to the disclosures on the accounting of leases 
in Notes 1, 12, 21 and 39 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
The financial statement risk 
As of December 31, 2020, right-of-use assets of € 2,430 million and lease liabilities of € 2,722 million are 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG. Depreciation of right-of-use assets 
amounted to € 684 million in financial year 2020. Interest expenses totaled € 90 million. 
Due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the resulting temporary closure of stores that are 
the subject of leases, adidas concluded changes to leases with numerous lessors, particularly in Q2 2020, 
which included changes to lease terms, changes to payment dates and/or the granting of subsidies by the 
lessor.  
These agreements are treated by adidas as lease modifications within the meaning of IFRS 16 and thus 
trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability and by extension the right-of-use asset using the 
incremental borrowing rate of adidas, which is to be applied to the property in question at the date of the 
lease modification.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Due to the large number and various types of lease modifications, the Company has set up group-wide 
processes and controls to ensure the modified contract data are recorded properly and in compliance with 
the relevant standards. 
There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets 
are not properly recorded and measured due to the lease modifications. 
Our audit approach 
In a first step, we obtained an understanding of the process for recording lease modifications with the 
adidas Group and assessed the accounting instruction for presenting lease modifications in accordance of 
IFRS 16. 
We assessed the setup and appropriateness of the controls implemented within the adidas Group to 
ensure the proper determination and recording of the relevant data for measuring the lease liabilities and 
right-of-use assets in the case of lease modifications. Relevant data are the lease term, the amount and 
dates of the lease payments and the relevant incremental borrowing rate of adidas for the property in 
question as well as the subsidies granted by the lessors. Where IT systems were used to determine and 
collect the relevant data, we tested the effectiveness of the rules and procedures of the underlying 
accounting-related IT systems, with the involvement of our IT experts.  
With the involvement of our valuation experts, we compared the assumptions and data underlying the 
incremental borrowing rates with our own assumptions and publicly available data. We also assessed the 
calculation model for the interest rate in terms of appropriateness. 
Using a standard report (RECESH) in SAP RE/FX, we were presented with an overview of all lease 
modifications in financial year 2020. We checked the completeness and accuracy of this SAP report with 
the help of our IT specialists. 
Furthermore, for certain lease modifications that were selected as part of a representative sample or on 
the basis of risk, we checked whether, based on the inspection of the selected leases, the classification as 
a ‘lease modification’ by the local adidas companies is appropriate and the relevant data for measuring the 
lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset were correctly determined and recorded. 
With the help of our IT specialists, we satisfied ourselves that the lease modifications are properly 
measured in SAP RE/FX. 
Our observations 
The approach for the balance sheet presentation of lease modifications in accordance with IFRS 16 is 
appropriate and is in line with the accounting policies.  
Other Information 
The Executive Board or the Supervisory Board is responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the following components of the management report, whose content was not 
audited: 
─ the components of the integrated combined non-financial statement, which are marked as unaudited, 
and 
─  the corporate governance statement with the corporate governance report.

The other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report. 
The other information does not include the consolidated financial statements, the group management 
report information audited for content and our auditor's report thereon. 
Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover 
the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.  
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider 
whether the other information 
─ is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management 
report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
─ otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
In accordance with our engagement letter, we conducted a separate assurance engagement of the 
combined non-financial statement. Please refer to our assurance report dated February 24, 2021, for 
information on the nature, scope and findings of this assurance engagement. 
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and the Group Management Report 
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in 
all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German 
commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, 
and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal 
control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the 
Group's ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the 
going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of a group management report that, 
as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately 
presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible 
for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary to enable the preparation 
of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and 
to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the 
Group Management Report 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material 
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of 
future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report.  
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
(IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group 
management report. 
We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
─ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of 
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 
─ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group 
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. 
─ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Executive Board and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board and related disclosures. 
─ Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. 
─ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant 
to Section 315e (1) HGB. 
─ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and 
on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.

─ Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, 
its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides. 
─ Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Executive Board in the 
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in 
particular, the significant assumptions used by the Executive Board as a basis for the prospective 
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these 
assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the 
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ 
materially from the prospective information. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant 
etchical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

We conducted our assessment of the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the group 
management report contained in the above-mentioned electronic file in accordance with 
Section 317 (3b) HGB and the Exposure Draft of the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance in accordance 
with Section 317 (3b) HGB on the Electronic Reproduction of Financial Statements and Management 
Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes (ED IDW AsS 410). Accordingly, our responsibilities are further 
described below. Our audit firm has applied the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for 
Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QS 1). 
The Company's Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the 
electronic reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in 
accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 2 HGB. 
In addition, the Company's Executive Board is responsible for the internal controls it considers necessary 
to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the 
requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error. 
The Company's Executive Board is also responsible for the submission of the ESEF documents together 
with the auditor’s report and the attached audited consolidated financial statements and audited group 
management report as well as other documents to be published to the operator of the German Federal 
Gazette [Bundesanzeiger]. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the preparation of the ESEF documents as part of the 
financial reporting process. 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from 
material non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance 
engagement. We also: 
─ Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance 
conclusion. 
─ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assessment of the ESEF documents in 
order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of these controls. 
─ Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the electronic file containing the 
ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the 
technical specification for this electronic file. 
─ Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report. 
─ Evaluate whether tagging the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) provides an 
appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
REGARDING THE COMBINED NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
19
 
To the Supervisory Board of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach 
We have performed an independent limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement of 
adidas AG (further ‘Company’ or ‘adidas’) according to § 315b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), that 
is combined with the non-financial statement of the parent company in accordance with § 289b HGB, 
(further ‘combined non-financial statement’) for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020. 
As described in the section ‘Working conditions in our supply chain’ in the Report, 921 social compliance 
and environmental audits at suppliers were performed by inhouse technical staff as well as external third-
party monitors commissioned by adidas business entities and licensees. The reasonableness and accuracy 
of the conclusions from the performed audit work were not part of our limited assurance engagement. 
Management’s responsibility 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the combined non-
financial statement in accordance with §§ 315b, 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB. 
This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate 
methods to prepare the combined non-financial statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for 
individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. Furthermore, the legal 
representatives are responsible for the internal controls they deem necessary for the preparation of the 
combined non-financial statement that is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements. 
Practioner’s responsibility 
It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the combined non-financial statement based on our work 
performed within a limited assurance engagement. 
We conducted our work in the form of a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other 
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, published by IAASB. Accordingly, we have to 
plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we obtain limited assurance as to whether 
any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the combined non-financial statement 
of the Company for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020 has not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB. We do not, however, 
issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure. As the assurance procedures performed in a limited 
assurance engagement are less comprehensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, the level of 
assurance obtained is substantially lower. The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s 
own judgement. 
  
 
19 Our engagement applied to the German version of the combined non-financial statement 2020. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report 
issued in German, whereas the German text is authoritative.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 
Within the scope of our engagement we performed, amongst others, the following procedures: 
─ Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for the materiality analysis in order to 
understand the processes for determining material topics and respective reporting boundaries for 
adidas AG 
─ A risk analysis, including media research, to identify relevant information on  
adidas AG’s sustainability performance in the reporting period
 
─ Reviewing the suitability of internally developed Reporting Criteria  
─ Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the collection, 
processing and monitoring of disclosures, including data consolidation, on environmental, employee 
and social matters, respect for human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters 
─ Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for determining disclosures on concepts, due 
diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control functions and consolidating 
disclosures 
─ Inspection of selected internal and external documents 
─ Analytical procedures for the evaluation of data and of the trends of quantitative disclosures as 
reported at group level by all sites  
─ Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of 
reported data based on a sample of the sites in Tianjin, China and Spartanburg, United States 
In our opinion, we obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence for reaching a conclusion for the assurance 
engagement. 
Independence and quality assurance on the part of the auditing firm 
In performing this engagement, we applied the legal provisions and professional pronouncements 
regarding independence and quality assurance, in particular the Professional Code for German Public 
Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German 
Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements 
in audit practice (IDW QS 1). 
Conclusion 
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the combined non-financial statement of adidas AG for the period from 
January 1 to December 31, 2020, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with 
§§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB.

GLOSSARY 
/ A 
Athleisure 
The term is composed of the words athletic and leisure. It describes a fashion trend of sportswear no 
longer being just meant for training but increasingly shaping everyday clothing. 
Accessories and gear 
A product category which comprises equipment that is used rather than worn by the consumer, such as 
bags, balls, or fitness equipment 
/ B 
BIPOC 
BIPoC stands for ‘Black, Indigenous and People of Color’. 
/ C 
3Cs 
The ‘3Cs’ stand for creativity, collaboration and confidence. It is adidas’ goal to develop a culture that 
cherishes creativity, collaboration and confidence as well as high performance – the behaviors we deem 
crucial to the successful delivery of our corporate strategy. In fact, our culture and people serve as the 
foundation and a key enabler of our new strategy ‘Own the Game’. 
Creators Club 
Creators Club is a membership program that helps us deepen the relationship with our consumers. 
Linking all adidas apps, events, communities and channels into one single profile, the program rewards 
members with points for interacting with the brand, e.g. when making a purchase or using the ‘adidas 
Running’ or ‘adidas Training’ apps. Depending on the number of points, exclusive benefits are unlocked, 
including access to hype sneaker and apparel drops or invitations to special events. 
Cash pooling 
A cash management technique for physical concentration of cash. Cash pooling allows adidas to combine 
credit and debit positions from various accounts and several subsidiaries into one central account. This 
technique supports our in-house bank concept where advantage is taken of any surplus funds of 
subsidiaries to cover cash requirements of other subsidiaries, thus reducing external financing needs and 
optimizing our net interest expenses. 
Controlled space 
Includes own-retail business, mono-branded franchise stores, shop-in-shops, joint ventures with retail 
partners and co-branded stores. Controlled space offers a high level of brand control and ensures optimal 
product offering and presentation according to brand requirements. 
Conversion rate 
A key ratio in retail business describing the number of buying customers compared to those who entered 
the store without buying something; i.e. a 25% conversion rate means that 100 persons entered a store 
with 25 of them buying something.

Leadership framework

(the ‘3Cs’) and articulates the particular behaviors that are expected of leaders at adidas. The framework 
was developed jointly with employees worldwide who provided feedback on what great leadership within 
adidas looks like to them. It provides a global and universal language that is inclusive, reduces the need 
for local interpretations and outlines concrete behaviors that serve as a measure of leadership 
effectiveness. It is built into the way we hire and promote as well as rate performance.

and coastal communities before reaching the ocean. Parley for the Oceans works with its partners to 
collect, sort and transport the recovered raw material (mainly PET bottles) to our supplier who produces 
the yarn, which is legally trademarked. It is used as a replacement for virgin plastic in the making of 
adidas x Parley products.
