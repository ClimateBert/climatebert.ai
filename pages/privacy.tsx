          <p>
            We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the

            a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
            processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
            permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
            commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
            will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
          </p>
          <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
          <p>
            A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only
            subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any

            (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
            OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
            SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
            PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
            DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF
            YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED

          <h3>
            Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled
            to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the
            member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of
            work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right
            to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
            administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we
            automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to
            fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a
            commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the
            direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done
            only if it is technically feasible.
          </p>
          <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
          <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
            content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as
            the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS
            encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
            checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
            “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon
            in the browser line.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
            cannot be read by third parties.
          </p>
          <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
          <p>
            Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have
            the right to at any time demand information about your archived
            personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of
            the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your
            data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this
            subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do
            not hesitate to contact us at any time.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far
            as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you
            may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of
            processing applies in the following cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
              archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this
              claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you
              have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your
              personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
              unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
              the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication
              of this data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
              exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right
              to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
              instead of its eradication.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
              rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other.
              As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you
              have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your
              personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
            data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only
            subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
            entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
            legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
            European Union or a member state of the EU.

          </p>
          <p>
            These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
            inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required
            for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases,
            the data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in
            the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f)

            been obtained.

          <p>
            The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until

            The processing of the information entered into the newsletter
            subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your
            consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have
            given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address and the use of
            this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for
            instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter.
            This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
            processing transactions that have taken place to date.

            The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the
            newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the
            newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the
            newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the
            newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to apply. We reserve the
            right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter
            distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our
            legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your
            e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service
            provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from
            the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with
            other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in
            complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters
            (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The
            storage in the blacklist is indefinite.
            <strong>
              You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our
              legitimate interest.
